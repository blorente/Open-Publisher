# Prologue

*thump, thump*.

*Thump, Thump*.

*THUMP, THUMP*.

“No!”

The smell of damp laundry filled my nostrils as the hab block shook with the mag-tram passing outside. Heart pumping, I reached blindly across the room for the wedding ring.

“It’s not real. Oh, Vivien, be with me.”, I uttered, breathless as I clutched the tiny piece of metal to my bare chest.

I opened my eyes, trying to bring my breath back to a reasonable pace. The cracks of the window projected on the ceiling, lit up by the passing carriages. I lied on my bed a little longer, letting the dancing lights take my mind away from the nightmare.

This had been the worst one yet.

Eventually, my chest started to slow down. I started noticing my surroundings; the stains of sweat on the sheets, the boots of the upstairs neighbours getting ready for the day, and the metallic smell of blood.

“That’s new.”

I looked down at my hands. I’d been holding on to the ring too hard. It had left a deep cut in the soft skin of my palm. With a grimace of pain, I let go of it.

They were definitely getting worse. I hand’t been able to get a good night’s sleep for ages. Not since my Cognitor reassignment. I didn’t know how many more nights like those I could take.

I swallowed hard, battling that thought. The MILITIA clearance was a sign that the Corporation itself had noticed my diligence and skill. The promotion was good. Besides, they wouldn’t have given me the job if they didn’t think I had the strength to bear any load it carried, would they?

As the last echoes of the nightmare dissipated from my mind, I got up to get ready for work.

---

The warm smell of freshly brewed caffeine quickly filled the room, making the episode a few moments earlier seem like… well… a bad dream. I brought the warm cup to my lips with a bandadged hand as I looked outside the window above the sink.

Above, below, all around me, people were exiting their rockrete hab-blocks and heading down the long staircases, to the mag-train station in Level 80, East Quadrant. They were heading upcity, most of them to work in the Grand Archive in some capacity. I would be joining them soon enough.

As I continued sipping my drink, the 08:90 train made its way to the station. That was my cue. I started getting dressed.

---

“Faustus! You ready mate?” - I heard Jorrick shout outside, his words punctuated by his fists slamming the door.

Of course I was ready. I wouldn’t – *couldn’t*, get to work late. Not now, not serving the Corporation directly.

“Mhm…” - I answered calmly, as the door to my hab slid open.

“About time!”, he smiled. “That caffeine I smell?”. I handed him a plastek cup. “Aha! Cheers.”, he said, taking a big gulp. “Vivian bless you mate!” he said with a wink.

I smiled – despite his sarcasm – feeling the familiar cold of the wedding ring in my hand. I certainly hoped she did. I missed her.

We started down the stairs, making our way to Level 80. The morning chill was greatly nullified by the usual mass of bodies going to the station. Boots were clinking and clanking their way down the zig-zagging metal staircases of the hab-block complex. Thousands of these hard-cold steps covered the facade of The Grids, as the buildings were affectionately known. Still, there was never enough room in rush hour.

Pushing and pulling, twisting and turning, we descended. I could feel the sweat of other people on my skin by the time we reached the station and got on the mag-tram. I’m sure I must have spilled caffeine on someone’s clothes by accident.

“So? How’s the new office?” asked Jorrick with a smirk, as we reached the platform and stopped to catch our breath.

I smiled. A Cognitor was an office as much as the ground levels were a PleaseCog bar.

“You know I can’t talk about it”

“I know, I know. It’s just you’ve been… odd, lately. Not that I’m complaining about the raise” he said, raising the caffeine cup. He smiled, but his eyes betrayed his concern. “I reckon you’ve not got some proper shut-eye in a while.”

“Mhm…”. I sipped as we hurried inside the packed carriage. Jorrick shrugged.

“PLEASE ENSURE THAT ALL EXTREMITIES ARE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE AT ALL *clang*”. The mechanized voice of the speakers got interrupted by a loud snap of the closing doors. With a tug, the mag-train started accelerating towards the spires. I stared at the rows of rockrete hab-blocks, their facades blackened by the ever-present mist of the lower hive.

---

The train was shaking in its suspensions as it rushed through the Medic district. Five long white marble strips, no more than three stories tall, formed the bulk of the hospital complex. They were arranged in a neat circle, all reaching out from a spire of contrasting red stone, some twenty stories tall, and windowless.

“You know? I’ve always found the Fingers surprisingly similar to a Cognitor” I said, turning to Jorrick. I wrangled my arm, trying to bring the cup to my lips through the backs and chests of the surrounding workers filling the space.

“Huh. Yeah, I can see it.” He paused for a bit, as if digesting the epiphany “Bugger! Now not even the nuts will let you get away from the damn things.”

“You do know that most people heal from Pod Disease”. I finally got the cup to my lips, barely spilling anything.

“The voices stop alright, but that ain’t ‘healing’ in my book. Like putting a jackhammer to your head! I reckon they built the Fingers so low so that us poor ninkers won’t die if we jump off. They don’t care about your broken back, if your mind’s still sharp.”

He did have a point. Just like Pod Disease affected everyone differently, it was hard to predict what the resets would do to the workers that ended up in the Fingers.

I looked around the carriage; oddly, nobody seemed to rise an eyebrow at the mention of such a sensitive topic. Had they not heard Jorrick? He certainly had been loud enough.

A couple of urban fliers zoomed past the train, towards one of the Medic buildings. They were painted in Enforcer bronze, shining bright against the red and white backdrop.

That didn’t help Jorrick’s mood. “Bet they’re coming from the Grids, those ninkers.”

I sighed. They probably were, on their way to drop some poor soul. “They are fulfilling their duty, just like you and me.”

“Ha! Cleaning up the mess of the Corporation? Some job that is.”

“Shush! Don’t speak like that!” I was the one shouting now. At the sound of my voice, people lifted their heads, startled.

“It just ain’t right! How long do you think till one of those Pods drives *you* nuts? Talk about the Emperor all you want, but I see what they’re doing to you.”

“Jorrick!” Why were people staring at me? Jorrick was the one shouting heresy!

“I know, I know.” His tone softened, suddenly realizing he had crossed a line. “Just worry about my caffeine supply, is all”.

He raised his cup and smiled, and I sighed and did the same. I looked out the window, and couldn’t help but wonder.

How long indeed?

---

Finally, the mag-tram arrived at its final destination. The crowd started pouring out of the carriage, filling the narrow streets that led to the worker’s entrance of the Grand Archive. After a brief stop to find a bin to dispose of my cup, I took out my ID pass and made my way to the lines forming at the entrance gates.

I looked around, but Jorrick was not there anymore. I hadn’t seen him step off the train either. I shrugged. *Probably lost in the crowd.*

The line of workers shambled forwards, silently slipping into the Grand Archive like rain being swallowed by the gutter. I looked up, shielding my eyes from the sunlight.

The Great Archive was high enough in Decorat to be free of the smog. Its myriad of gothic towers reached into the clear sky. The cold morning light turned vibrant shades of green, red and gold when it reflected in the hundreds of stained glass windows. My favourite, “The Sacrifice of Vassili Oberon”, stood at the tip of the smallest tower.

I touched my signet, closed my eyes, and let the sound of a prayer inundate me with light.

“Vivian, please give me strength to fullfill the duty that I’ve been assigned”.

The story of Vassili Oberon, how he saved the whole Solar Empire by standing in the way of the Derelict general during the Great Expansion, reminds us all that we are all important to the glory of the Empire. That our work and determination will be rewarded.

“Give me courage to face the horrors, and strength to -”

“Move it!” Somebody shoved me forward in the queue. I stumbled, and realized I was already at the gates.

“Sorry, sorry…” I felt the warmth inside of me fade away with the cold stab of the morning chill. I fumbled through my coat, looking for my ID.

Front pockets? No. “Oi! Your Holy Grace! I said move it! I can’t be late again!”

Breast pockets? No. “Sir, you you’re blocking the queue”. A gate guard was waving his arms, signaling me to hurry.

“Yes, just a moment.” I was completely cold now “I can’t find my pass”

“It’s in your hand, sir”. The guard could barely hide a sigh.

“Oh.” I blushed, looked down, and scanned the pass without a word. As soon as the display beeped green, I rushed through the gates.

I had taken less than ten paces from the gates when my hand started feeling strange. Almost as if it was missing something…

“My ring!” I spun towards the gate. My feet tried to run, but the rest of my body couldn’t fight the human tide pouring into the building.

“Let me through, please! I need to get my ring back”. Some people in front of me tried to make way. They were quickly pushed back by the vacant-eyed mass of people that poured relentlessly into the building.

I waved my arms, signalling to the guard that had hurried me before. He was picking something off the ground. When he saw me, he turned his head towards me.

“I’m sorry sir, you’re going to have to come and pick this up later.” The guard put the ring in his pocket.

“No, I need that! I need her –”

“Move along!” He commanded, and turned back to attend the incoming crowd.

My heart was racing, and I felt weak in my knees. I would have fallen down, if there had been a free inch of floor to do so. The thumps of pumping blood were ringing in my ears, just like last night. The burning city. Billions being massacred. The sharp lights of orbital lances sweeping across districts. Chain explosions following a second later. The fire, the screams, the stench of burning flesh. “Oh no, oh Vivian, please -”

“You ’eard ’im, move it!” Two strong hands turned me towards the ascending staircase, and shoved me forward.

I snapped out of it. The smell of smoke lingered, but before me no longer stood the ashen plain. Instead, a great staircase spiralled towards the high ceiling, connecting the different sections of the Grand Archive.

I forced myself to take a step forward. Then another one. Stumbling, I joined the crowd once again, making my way towards Cognitor 36B, Sectio Militia.

I would have to come back for the ring later. I just hoped I would have the strength to get through the day.

---

As I got higher in the spiral staircase, the crowd started thinning. The higher floors of the Grand Archive were limited to the MILITIA clearance levels, where Inspectors and their retinue came to do their research, and the generals and high-level bureaucrats of the future came to study the past.

I inhaled deeply, letting the smell of static banish the last remnants of the battle for the second time this day. I stopped, appreciating the privilege of having such breathing room.

Yes, it was hard work to retrieve and process documents for the Inquisition. Yes, some of those images stuck like memories. But I had been chosen, and I had a duty to fulfill. They wouldn’t have chosen me otherwise. I needed to brave what may come. And besides…

“Vivian is with me”.

The words made my hands a little bit warmer. I clenched my fists, and carried on, up to my station.

---

Cognitor 36B, Sectio Militia was cold that day. Two men in janitor uniforms were cleaning the green carpet surrounding the ten Retriever stations, in preparation for the shift change.

When I got into the room, Archiver Arsenus emmitted a series of electrical buzzes, punctuated by a steam cloud that sprouted from an opening in his red robes, where his mouth would have been. The Archiver had a perfect view of the room from the plinth he was affixed to, and he had the rare custom to greet his Operators at the start of each shift.

“Good morning to you as well, Archiver” I returned the greeting as I walked around the circle of leatherbound armchairs, to station 8.

My station was empty. “Excuse me, do you know what happened to Herc?” I asked the night shift Operator to my right, as she was rising from her armcahair, getting ready to leave.

“Damn ninker never showed up.” She said. Her breath was still irregular from the last dive, her pupils dilated. “He better come back with a good excuse and a bottle of truwine to share. Now if you’ll excuse me, I can’t be here anymore.” Without one more word, she shambled down the room.

The rest of people in my shift were already connected. I sat on my station, readying myself. A chill ran down my spine as the HUD of my helmet lit up. I felt my pulse rise again, and I touched the place where my ring had been moments ago. I grimaced in pain as my fingers brushed the bandages of this morning’s cut.

I managed to coerce my shaky hands to strap the belts and perform final checks. “Vivian is with me. She will give me the strength.” It was going to be a long day.

My display signalled the successful connection, and ten minds prepared to dive into the depths of the Archive. Reading, watching, sifting, trying to find answers to the queries of the Solar Empire.

“WELCOME, RETRIEVERS OF THE ARCHIVE.” Even through the helmet’s vox interface, Artificer Arsenus’s voice was canny, more machine than human.

“THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. YOU ARE THE BEST RETRIEVERS IN DECORAT, FOR WHICH YOU WERE CHOSEN. YOU ARE THE ELITE. MAKE US PROUD.” These words marked the imminent dive. Usually, hearing them made me feel proud to be serving the Empire. Today, they made me taste vomit at the back of my throat.

A cold hand gripped my heart. I wasn’t ready for this, not again. Cannonfire raged in the back of my mind. I closed my eyes until white dots were dancing inside my pupils and gripped the leather of the armrests, trying to make it go away. Trying to prepare for–

“CAPTAIN ARGOLES, UNIT AURORA, THE DISASTER OF BASKET-43. DATE 7.492. FILE PREFIXES 50123 TO 109034” declared Arsenus.

“LET US BEGIN” And we plunged into a sea of data.

I opened a set of recordings. Within nanoseconds, I was seeing the world from the cockpit of a fighter jet, flying over a majestic parade. Millions of souls cheered as the Empire’s finest marched by a newly conquered planet. I started feeling a sense of pride as I watched the impeccable legions of humanity.

It didn’t last long. When we were reaching the crowd, the fighter dived into it, and opened fire. As the automatic guns raked through the crowds, I realized this recording was from a traitor pilot. I felt sick as I spectated first hand the flier’s guns cutting down thousands of civilians, seconds before precipitating to a fiery, sudden death when the Imperium opened fire. No sign of Argoles.

I had to keep searching. My mind jumped from file to file, processing each before moving on to the next one. I found picts of burning buildings, sound recordings of agonizing people, and death rolls that numbered the thousands. But no Argoles.

“Found it!” Said one of the other Operators.

Our minds snapped back into place, and I gasped for air.

“File 89342, it’s a camera feed from his helmet.”

“WELL DONE. THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.” Without a pause, he added “LET US CONTINUE. INSPECTOR HONDURAS, BATTLE OF VITRIAL-9. DATE 8.342, FILE PREFIXES 70997 TO 134299”.

And we sunk, back to fire and blood.

---

By the tenth query, my head was about to explode. Quick breaths drew the smell of blood, coming from the wound in my hand. I must have opened it again by gripping my chair too hard.

My legs were still shaking from the impact of the last explosion. An alien weapon, somewhere in the far reaches of the Empire, splitting some Major Friedrik in half.

“STATION 8, PLEASE REMAIN FOCUSED”

“A moment, please! I just need to catch –”

“LET US CONTINUTE. INSPECTOR DORCAS, —”.

In my confusion, I missed the file coordinates. Desperate, I opened the first recording I found. I was trapped in a box of steel, surrounded by several other people. A horde of alien beasts were charging towards the group. The others opened fire trying, to slow them down. I heard the roar of las-cannons coming from my cage join the cacophony. It wasn’t enough.

The ravenous beasts didnt even need to stop as their long, blade-like claws tore through the people around me. Some of them attacked the box, and their blade-like limbs ringed with the sound of metal on metal: *clang, clang, clang*.

Whatever I was inside of was sturdy, but every attack opnened bigger gaps in its armor. They started surrounding us, burying the viewport in a flurry of steel and blood.

It was too much. I could feel blood rushing to my ears, and I started gasping for breath. Sharp pain enveloped me as I felt my head – my real head – hit violently against my station’s pillow.

My head exploded, and the world went white.

---

I wake up to the echoes of metal claws ringing in my ears. *clang, clang, clang*. As I come to, eyes still closed, I realize it’s a different sound.

*Tap, tap, tap*.

I feel fresh sheets rub against my bruised neck, sending a sharp pain stab at the back of my head.

Fresh sheets.

This isn’t my station.

“Good morning, Faustus” I hear a voice say. The tapping stops for a second.

I try to open my eyes, but only the left one obeys. The right one responds with a sharp stab of pain instead.

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. That’s a nasty bruise you have there.”

My sight finally comes into focus. The well-lit room is empty, except for a single woman sitting on a chair, talking to me. She is dressed in starched Medicae uniform, and is scratching the glossy surface of her dataslate as he scribbles something. *Tap, tap, tap*.

“Wh-Where am I?” My lips feel heavy and dry. I can barely form the words.

“You’re in Unit 498, East Medic. You gave us a good scare this morning”.

At that mention, I see a flash of sharp, bloody metal claws. My heart skips a beat. I take a deep breath, pushing the memory away.

“What’s going to happen to me?” A note of desperation betrays my feigned confidence. I don’t think my bruises are the reason I’m in the Fingers – I suspect she doesn’t, either.

“Well, Faustus, we’re going to make you all better.” The woman’s lips form a practiced smile. Her eyes don’t. “Don’t you worry. Soon, you’ll feel… good as new” *Tap, Tap, Tap*.

I swallow hard. So it *is* a reset. I try to raise my hands, but tight leather bondages bite into my wrists. The woman’s note-taking accelerates as she sees my struggle.

“Please Faustus, try to calm down”.

My head starts spinning, and my heart racing. Those damn taps turn back into resounding claws: *Clang, clang, clang*.

“You can’t do this to me! I just got a promotion! The Empire needs me in the Archive!” I’m seeing flashes of red now. Flying, thick, wet streaks of blood red. My whole body’s shaking, trying to get out of this damn bed.

She shrugs, putting the dataslate down. “Have it your way.” The smile gone from her lips. The tapping has stopped, but the damage is done. I can barely hear her footsteps approaching through the sounds of battle, but I do feel her hand touching a control beside my head.

Immediately, my body goes numb, and my eyes feel heavy. The blood washes away from my sight, like the the rain wiping off the windows of a train.

“Now, go to sleep”

As I submerge in a pool of nothingness, I hear the woman’s footsteps going away. The door slams shut, leaving me alone in the room.

“Prepare worker FA-X16S for reset” She’s talking to someone outside. I can barely hear her.

“Again, ma’am? Less than a year after the last one? The odds of recovery are –”

“He’s critical. We don’t want another case like that monster Jorrick.” The woman pauses, and I hear the tapping sound again. Through the haze of the sedatives, The name *Jorrick* sounds familiar.

“Oh, would you look at that! According to the file, he and the patient were friends before the man finally snapped and did a number on The Grids. Had to put him in the freezer. Now, we don’t want another one of those, do we?”

“Of course not, ma’am.”

“Well then get to it. Not like he’ll be missed.”

As the footseps fade away into the corridor, the room goes dark.

From a corner of the empty room, I hear Jorrick’s voice.

“Guess you didn’t have that long after all, mate.”

# Planetfall

She elbowed her way out of the personnel carrier.

All things considered, she decided she didn’t want to be there. She was annoyed that they'd made her come bacl. No, not just annoyed. Furious.

Coming back to her home world, four decades later, was good. Great, even. She was looking forward to telling Olin and her father all about the expansion mission. What wasn’t good, however, was leaving the campaign months before getting her promotion to Captain.

Just a week before the damn communique had arrived, she had managed to get her achievents in front of the right people, just as a position opened. It would take her years, if not decades, to build her reputation back up.

Erika Belcroft sighed heavily, straightened her military fatigues, and looked around. Decorat’s starport was largely the same it had been when she left, early in her twenties. Unlike then, though, the lobbies were now packed, and the queues full.

*That’s exactly the welcome you want after a month cooped up in a commercial carrier*, Erika thought, as she pushed through the hundreds of bodies that clogged the exit gates of Terminal 5. *A warm, sticky, sweaty welcome.* She was starting to regret not splurging on a private transport.

She felt Tristan rub against her leg. He had probably noticed her disgust, as he always did. As soon as she found a spot of unoccupied floor, she knelt down and pet her companion cat. He purred, and rubbed his head against her hand. That made Erika feel a little better.

“You always know what to say, friend” Erika said. “Still, it’ll be easier if we’re together. Up!”

Erika tapped her shoulder, and Tristan’s mechanical legs whirred as he jumped to perch on her shoulder. They locked in place, latching to the mechanical harness that Erika was wearing of over her right shoulder and belt.

Above the bustle of people, the glass dome of the starport gave way to a dark void of nothingness. Seeing the pitch black sky, Erika missed the stars. Expansion missions often took her to small colonies, where humanity had only begun to settle. Here, in the millenary world of Decorat, the light belched out of billions of homes drowned the night sky.

Her thoughts were brusquely interrupted. Somebody accidentally shoved her when passing by, forcing Erika to come back to reality, ready to retaliate against whoever had had the audacity. Instead, she saw something surprising.

Usually, most people poured straight into the mag-tram stations that would take them to the lower levels of the city. Wealthy individuals would go up to the flier platform, to get an aircab or rent a gravcar. Wherever it was, people were always *moving* in the starport.

Right now, however, people were standing still. The crowd had frozen in place, forming a circle around something. Dozens, hundreds of people all watching whatever was going on in the small area in its center.

Erika blinked, and her augmetic right eye zoomed into the crowd. Whatever was holding their attention, it was also standing between her and a much deserved bath.

Another zoom revealed a man, alone, in the middle of the opening, shouting in the face of anyone who dared come close.

She looked around. No Enforcers in sight. She sighed. She’d have to do something about it herself.

Thinking of the hot bath and cup of caffeine that were waiting for her at home, she elbowed her way in through the hurricane of plastic clothes and sweaty flesh.

“Sir, in the name of the Solar Empire, I’m going to need you to calm down and shut up.” She said, as she popped out of the wall of pedestrians somewhat, less graciously than she would have liked.

“Foolish girl! They’re coming!” said the man. Erika felt the crowd retract behind her as the man stomped towards her.

*Heh,* She thought, *It’s been a while since somebody called me “girl”.*

As the man got within an inch of her face, Erika noticed his eyes. He was so close Erika could smell the cheap liquor in his breath, but he wasn’t looking _at_ her. He was looking _past_ her, as if staring into the horizon. Despite that, Erika lowered her left hand to grip the hilt of the power estoc hidden in her cane. _Just in case._

“Sir, I’m asking you nicely. Please calm down, and step away”. Given the situation, she didn’t have too much hope, but she had to make it look like she was trying.

“Czokron! Scerzhond! Zhamnuz! Kyriel! Kyriel! It’s coming! I’ve seen it! You will all fall, only their true servants will thrive! You’ll see them and despair!”

At “despair”, a drip of wet gooey spit propelled out of the man’s mouth, landing squarely on Erika’s cheek.

*Alright, that does it.* The man didn’t even have time to react.

She struck with her cane. A short, dry, calculated hit to the man’s diaphragm.  He gasped for air, and doubled over in pain. Before he could process what had just happened, a quick sidestep and a trained punch to the back of the head finished the job. The man was unconscious before he touched the ground.

Erika took out the handkerchief from her stormcoat, wiped the man’s snot from her cheek, and pet Tristan. “We’ll be home soon, dear”.

“FREEZE!”

Erika — and the rest of the crowd — looked up. Bright spotlights pierced the night, lighting Erika and the fallen man. They were shortly followed by two Enforcer fliers making their way down to the scene.

*It’s about time.* Erika thought. The crowd started dispersing with a distinct sense of urgency. Enforcers from the Solar Empire did that to people. She sighed, and raised her hands. She didn’t like to be kept waiting.

By the time the fliers had made it to ground, Erika, Tristan and the sprawled man were the only souls left. The polished steel doors opened with a hiss of steam, and two figures stepped out of the vehicles.

“What’s going on here?” said the first Enforcer. Their voice denoted her as a young woman, though it was hard to distinguish through her uniform’s breastplate and black visor. She was pointing her stub gun towards Erika, and was followed by another, taller figure, holding a riot gun.

“Just doing your job, agent.” Erika replied, hands still up. “I am Erika. _Belcroft_. This man was spewing nonsense and instilling disorder.” Erika lowered her head, directing the agent’s eyes towards the house insignia etched on the breastpocket of her shirt. “May I show you my identification?”

The agent nodded, and Erika handed the guard her ID card.

The officer started reading “Erika Belcroft, —”

“That’s *Major* Erika Belcroft for you, *Enforcer*.” Erika interrupted.

“Right.” Her tone sounded tired. Erika didn’t care. She handed the documents to her partner. “Check the records”. And the tall figure stepped back towards the fliers. She turned to Erika, still pointing her gun towards her – “Now, don’t move. Neither of us wants this to go bad”

“Of course, officer.” Said Erika. Tristan dropped from his perch with a clang, and fixed his eyes on the agent’s visor. “Don’t worry. He's harmless.”

The agent didn’t seem convinced, but opted to keep her gun pointing at Erika.

“ID checks out!” shouted the tall man. The female Enforcer let out a sigh of relief, and her body became visibly relaxed. She holstered her gun and slid her visor up, revealing a tired young face. There was a fierce determination behind the bags in her green eyes.

“We’re going to need you to come with us, for questioning.”

“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Said Erika, lowering her hands and kneeling to pet Tristan. “What’s your name, officer?”

“Vanya Minsk,” Said the officer, “and I’m afraid I must insist, Major Belcroft. This incident falls under an active investigation for the Enforcers, and we need everything we can get.”

*Now, that’s interesting. This is not an isolated incident, then.*

“Enforcer Minsk, I commend your diligence. However, I’m expected at House Belcroft this evening, and I’m _never_ late. You know my name and rank, and therefore you know you probably shouldn’t forcibly arrest me. Furthermore, this is an active investigation, so you can imagine what happened. You know that I didn’t do anything wrong, and I was acting in self-defense.”

_Pause for effect..._

“You’re going to have to let this one go.” Belcroft finished.

Minsk remained impassible, but Erika’s augmetic lens caught her teeth, gritting in frustration.

Erika stopped petting Tristan and stood up, addressing the Enforcer directly. “However, I do not want to stand in the way of our dear Enforcers. So, now that I have your name, I give you my word that I will visit you soon, to provide what aid I can.”

This was the best Minsk was going to get, and they both knew it. Erika could make a lot more trouble for Minsk that this case ever could. The Enforcer sighed, defeated.

“Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to be on my way.” Said Erika, turning towards the barren street. “Tristan, up!” She took a deep breath, feeling the night’s chill fill her lungs. She could make out the outline of the Grand Archive in the distance, at the other end of the city. Behind it, the Spire pierced the night sky. *Home*, thought Erika.

“See you soon!” She said to Minsk with a cutting tone, who had already started loading the man’s inert body in her flier.

She adjusted her coat around her shoulders, checked her cane and lasgun as force of habit, petted Tristan’s head, now perched on her right shoulder, and started walking down the street.

*It’s good to be back,* she thought, *but let’s see about that bath.*

---

A few minutes later, Erika was snatching the keys to the grav-car from the rental company's clerk. She uttered a dismissive "Thank you" and stomped towards the helipad, where all the rental vehicles were resting. The air was ever so slightly cleaner up there, ten floors up and away from the smog. Erika took a deep breath. She couldn’t wait to get home.

Guided by the tracker in the keychain, she found the car. A pristine two-seat Molotch, Series M. Expensive, but she would take every comfort she could get right now. As soon as she opened the doors, two things happened.

First, Tristan leapt into the car, with marked disregard for the new plas-leather covering the seats. His sharp, metallic claws tore deep gashes in the driver’s seat. At the same time, and more alarmingly, Erika heard somebody shout at her.

“Oi! Lady!”

The voice was… young. A boy, probably not more than fifteen. She could swear she heard him gulp as she turned to face him.

"_What._" She said, with all the fury of someone who’s had a really bad day. After a really bad month.

“I-… I’m sorry…” After the initial shock, the voice seemed to be regaining confidence “But you really messed up my plan! I was following that guy!”

The figure forward, enough to be lit up by one of the hololamps. Erika saw that the voice belonged to a scrawny kid, dirty and dressed in common Grid overalls. His clothes had holes in a few places, and his skin had the sickly paleness of someone who lives below the smog line. A street rat, one of billions in the civilised worlds managed by the Sagitar Corporation.

Erika had no patience for street rats right now.

“And why do I care?” Her tone conveyed how much she didn’t.

The boy looked confused. He clearly hadn’t thought about that before approaching.

“I... I...” He started. He lowered his gaze to the ground, fists clenched in frustration. "...he was my only hope." He looked about to crash into tears.

Erika didn’t know what he was hoping, or why that crazy man down there was the answer, and she definitely didn’t want to find out. She didn’t have ill will towards the boy. She just couldn’t be made to bother with anyone’s problems right now.

“Look, boy. I really don’t know what you were looking for and, to be honest, I don’t care. I didn’t mean to cause you harm, but I really must get going. Here, take this for your trouble.”

She handed him the change she had gotten from the grav-car rental place. The boy looked at her, eyes on fire with pain and disgust. He visibly clenched his jaw, but he took the money regardless. He turned and ran away without saying a word.

Erika stood there, watching him leave. After a few seconds, she sighed, got into the car, pet Tristan — who was now curled in the passenger seat — and pushed the event from her memory. It was time to go back home, and finally take that bath.

---

The propulsion engines of the grav-car started with a low hum, lifting Erika and Tristan up into the relatively empty airways. She set the course for Belcroft Manor, engaged the autopilot, and sank into the soft plas-leather cushions. She contemplated the city below her.

The capital city of a world with the same name, Decorat was a hive of contrast. It had been built — or, more precisely, it had grown — around a single building; The Grand Archive, which sat upon the only remaining hill in a planet battered by terraforming industry.

It was one of the most important repositories of knowledge for the Solar Empire, as it stored knowledge predating even the Great Expansion. The Sagitar Corporation realized the importance of that building for the Empire, and made it its business to pursue every profitable opportunity around it.

Over the centuries, the Corporation had engulfed the city, and now everything bore its six-point insignia. From the great supply transports that fed the city’s insatiable hunger, to the small businesses that sold semi-legal goods in the lower levels — everyone depended on Sagitar Corp.

*They have somehow gotten bigger*, Erika thought, as her flier passed one of the distribution centers in the smog. *Somehow, among this muck, they keep finding people to sell stuff to.*

The smog was the colloquial name that Decoratians used to refer to the area below the Grand Archive. The cooling process for the vast ocean of live datablocks that lived below the Archive had been expelling exhaust gasses for millenia. That, coupled with centuries of boundless industrialism, had polluted the atmosphere of Decorat, creating a thick, heavy, almost visible layer of smog that covered the vast towers of hab-blocks where most of the Decoratian population lived. Lung cancer was the first cause of death in the city which, incidentally, had netted Sagitar incredible profits in the pharmaceutical business.

Erika was very glad to be above the smog. She was starting to relax, and as her flier drifted above the stacked prefab blocks, she thought about her reason for coming back. She remembered the official Sagitar communication:

“Sagitar requires your immediate presence in Decorat, for an urgent matter pertaining your father.”

It was remarkably sparse, but it was also signed by Boris Markov, the Chief System Officer himself. One couldn't just reject his calls.

She still didn’t know what to believe. Surely, the Sagitar wouldn’t pull an officer from the frontlines for a light matter, but what could her father have done?

She was pondering these thoughts as the flier approached the center of the city. She could almost make out the shapes of the hillside. Progressively, the bigger buildings became clearer and clearer; the on-world Sagitar HQ, the Solar Empire Enforcer Bureau, the spire where high-ranking chancellors of Sagitar lived, and even the Grand Archive itself, with its old, gothic-pattern towers reaching to the skies.

Tristan purred beside her.

“We’ll be there soon, dear” Erika said, both to the cat and to herself.

As if it had listened to her, the smaller manors of rich families became visible on the hillside.

“There it is,” Said Erika, as she found the three-story house, exactly as she remembered it “Belcroft Manor. Let’s see what this is all about, shall we?”

She smiled, as the flier decelerated to descen into the Manor’s landing pad, in front of the house. THe street hadn't changed a bit in these four decades. She remembered being a child, playing hide and seek with Lizah and the other kids. Somehow. Lizah was the only one she'd eve lost to. Erika was faster, but she would always find a way to outsmart her.

_I may pay her a visit some day._

Maybe being back wasn’t so bad after all.

# Arrival

She landed, releasing a hiss of steam when the doors de-pressurized and opened. A few seconds later, Erika was standing at the gates of House Belcroft. Though small when compared to the biggest houses in Decorat, her family’s seat could comfortably accommodate a hundred guests.

Erika remembered playing with Olin all throughout the manor. Now, an air of abandon painted its facade. Most windows were shut and caked with dust, and the ornate marble stairway leading to the door was covered in fallen leaves from the garden’s synth-trees. A single light came out of the building. *Papa’s study,* Erika remembered.

Erika felt Tristan tense on her shoulder as they approached the main entrance. By the time she knocked at the wooden gate, he was growling.

“Shhh, dear. Everything’s fine.” She knew better than to try to pet the cat now, but her words seemed to calm him somewhat.

“We’re not expecting visitors. Please leave the premises immediately.” Said a familiar, but rather agitated voice from the other side of the door.

“It’s me, Olin. Erika.” she answered. Then, turning to Tristan “see? It’s just Olin!” something in her tone made the cat relax a little bit.

“Mamzel? Could that really be you? Pardon my impropriety, please come in, come in!” A loud clink, a pneumatic hiss and a metallic thud followed those words, unbolting the door. The reinforced blast door started moving into the house, revealing the old butler’s hunched figure. “I beg your pardon, but one needs be careful these times.”

“Careful with what, Olin?” asked Erika. What could be so bad that it could threaten them here, in the Hills? Even worse – what could be so bad that *Olin* couldn’t deal with it?

“Best not to discuss it here, mamzel. Come in, I’ll have the servos prepare refreshments.” He signalled inside.

As Erika stepped through the threshold, Olin said “will that… *thing* be joining us?” Tristan’s ears perked up at the mention. He chirped, and stared at the butler intently.

“Yes, Olin. Tristan will be joining us. He’s been with me for years, he’s not staying outside now.”

“As you please, mamzel. I hope he doesn’t break anything.” Tristan looked as innocent as he could, and Erika remembered the torn seats on the flier.

*He hasn’t changed a bit*, Erika thought as they followed the old butler to the social room upstairs, *but something’s got him on edge, and it’s not Tristan*. He still wore the same black suit with the gold-embroidered lining around the cuffs and neck, and he walked with the same surprisingly brisk pace for someone his age.

*The house, however, has changed somewhat in these forty years*. Erika couldn’t put her finger on it. I*t feels… colder*.

“It’s unlike you to be so nervous, Olin.” Erika said while they were climbing the main staircase.

“Forgive me mamzel, but recent events have not been kind on my nerves.”

They were at the top of the staircase, in front of her father’s study. A bright orange glow of electric lamps filtered from under the door.

“There’s someone here to see you” Olin said, and signalling the half-opened wooden door.

Erika cursed under her breath. *That is not my father in there, then.* Whoever it was, better have a damn good reason to come at this time. They were standing between her and a much needed bath.

“Thank you, Olin. That will be all for now.”

“Of course, mamzel. I will prepare your room.”

The butler shuffled away, and Erika pushed the door open.

Her father’s study was exactly as she remembered it. Jordan Belcroft had been a busy man, but he rarely deviated from schedule or custom. The figure sitting in his chair, however, wasn’t her father. It was a short man, dressed in an impeccable violet truvelvet suit. His features were as sharp as his dress code. Erika had seen his face around. It was Chief System Officer Boris Markov himself, the head of the Sagitar Corporation here in Decorat. He was, in all regards that really mattered, the most powerful person in the city. Perhaps, even in the sector.

*He’s also a friend of father’s*, Erika recalled. She still remembered his visits. Her father, Boris and the others would come, lock themselves in that very study, and talk for hours. Now, he was fiddling with her father’s pen collection.

“Welcome back, Mamzel Belcroft.” He said, playfully balancing a very rare Foulcault 3578 between his index and thumb. “I trust you had a pleasant journey from the frontlines.”

“It has… sir.” She said, curtly. She didn’t really care for pleasantries right now.

“I must commend your father on his collection. He always had impeccable taste.” He had carefully set down the pen, and had picked up a different one “Did you know that they only made a hundred of these particular models of Ydris?”

“I did not” Erika said, with the best impression of a calm voice she could muster.

“They did! And look at this one. An original Mormont Dreamweaver! I must ask your father where he got it.”

“I’m sure it will be a riveting conversation.” Erika was on the brink of failing to be civil. “With all due respect, sir. Did the Sagitar Corporation pull me from my duty to discuss _pens_?”

Markov laughed “No, of course not. I guess we should get down to business.” He hesitated, and then put the pen down in its holder. “In fact, the Corporation hasn’t called you for much of anything! _I_ have personally requested your presence here.”

He was smiling a friendly, fake smile.

"You see, I currently face a bit of a mysterious situation. Dissapearances in the lower levels are up by 3% since last year." By Erika's estimation, that amounted to a few million.

"Now, a few missing people here and there is nothing out of the ordinary, but if this trend continues, it could damage the planet’s productivity output. That would put my career prospects in, let’s say, thin ice. And that, I can’t have" For a moment, his face had suddenly turned menacing. Then he smiled again.

“I’m sorry about that, sir, but I fail to see how this relates to me.”

“Ah. I was about to get there. Even as a child, you were always very impatient. I guess some things don’t change.” He paused. Erika decided that she didn’t like Markov very much. She was tired, and fishing for information was not something she wanted to do right now.

Eventually, he continued.

“Your father was amongst the dissappeared.” He proclaimed, putting the pen down.

He let the words hang in the air for a moment.

“I must admit, I was expecting more of a reaction from you, Belcroft” He said, surprised.

Erika had to agree. She should have been more shocked, terrified even. But a mixture of exhaustion and the fact that she already suspected something like this made her eyelashes fail to bat.

“Sorry to disappoint” Was all she said.

“I’ll survive. That’s not the only reason you’re here, though. Although poor Jordan’s disappearance is a tragedy, it’s hardly enough reason to pull such a promising officer from the frontlines.”

He paused. Again. *He’s making me work for it, and he’s enjoying this a bit too much,* Erika thought. Still there wasn’t much she could do but play along. She was at his mercy, and they both knew it.

“And what is?” She said.

“I currently face a bit of a dilemma. It’s the house, you see.” He said, picking another pen

“This house?” Erika said.

“Yes! This very house, your family’s seat for generations.” Another pause.

“What about it?”

“Well, this house is not actually property of the Belcrofts. It is, and it always has been, a loan from the Corporation. Your father, and those before, were allowed to reside in it in exchange of their services to us. It was loaned for the lifetime of your father’s. I’m afraid that, with his disappearance, the corporation is left in the uncomfortable position of finding someone to replace his post, and give them this house.”

“Wait, that would mean…” Despite the exhaustion, Erika sensed a shiver down her spine. She looked around, to the hundreds of years of history the mansion contained.

“Yes, you would of course have to find… alternative accommodations.” He meant The Grid.

“That is, unless” He continued. “*You* were willing to fulfil his post.” He finished, with an inquiring smile.

*So that’s your real motivation,* Erika thought. *You need someone to cover my father’s spot, but you don’t want to go through the hassle of finding a replacement, so you coerce me into doing it.*

Erika had no desire to tie herself to a desk. She was born to be in the field, and she had worked too hard on her career to give it up now. But it didn’t look like she had much of a choice. She couldn’t let all of this, all of the history her ancestors had cultivated, crumble.

In that moment, an idea came to her head.

“Sir, you said my father has disappeared, right?”

“Yes, why?”

“Well, he’s disappeared, not dead. Or, at least, we don’t know that yet. Until we have confirmed that, the contract still holds. Does it not?”

The CSO paused for a second. He then smiled “I guess so, you’re right. But the contract states that he will be terminated if he fails to fulfill his duties in a set period of time. He’s been gone for a few weeks already, you see, and there are only a few days left.”

“Then I’ll find him.” Erika blurted. She surprised herself with how quickly she had gotten to that answer.

Markov’s eyes lit up at that exclamation.

“That could work, yes. If you can manage it, say, before the Data Entry Rites?” He stood in silence for a bit more, considering something. “Right. It’s decided. I know you don’t like me much, but I considered your father a friend. You will come to the council meeting tomorrow, and we will talk specifics and provide what aid we can give. I’ll have to find a way to spin it to the other chancellors. For now, I must go. It’s indeed getting late, and more urgent matters require my attention. I’ll show myself out.”

With that, the short man got up from the big armchair, and made for the exit. He opened the door to the study, then sopped and turned.

“Oh, one more thing, mamzel Belcroft.” Again, the smile gave way to that dark stare “I cannot stress how important it is to keep this secret. You were not the only one brought here by the missing people. I have word that the Empire is taking interest, and an Inspector has landed today.”

He let those words hang for a few seconds, to emphasize their gravity. Erika didn’t need it emphasized. An Inspector coming was a universal sign of something going very wrong.

Boris smiled again.

“Well then! See you tomorrow!” He said, as he went down the stairs.

Erika sat at his father’s desk, thinking. After some time, Olin came, with a couple of cups and a decanter full of aromatic caffeine.

“Thank you, Olin” Erika said, rubbing her eyes. Using her augmetic eye, She measured 200 milliliters in each cup, and handed one to Olin.

She took a sip of the caffeine. It was good, nutty and with acid notes. Some of the body had been lost in the brewing, though.

“Servos made this, correct?” She asked the butler.

“Yes, mamzel. Your taste is as impeccable as your father’s. He also noticed these things.”

“I know,” She answered, sullenly. “He taught me. It’s good though, not bad for a machine.”

“Thank you. I’ve been trying to program them to reproduce my brewing.” The butler seemed distracted with something. “Mamzel, about Markov.”

“Yes?” She took a second sip.

“Is everything alright?” The butler asked.

She took a deep breath, trying to process what had just happened.

“No, Olin.” She sunk into the armchair, rubbing her temples. “It is not. But we will make it right.”

# Home

Rien was annoyed as he got to the magtram station. Using his rig-card, he skipped over the toll gates. Luci had helped him develop the small plastic key, and now he could travel for free across all of Decorat.

By the time the train stopped in the deserted station of Level 185, he was fuming.

*Two weeks! Two weeks I’d been following that ninker, and she comes off that big ship all fancy, and gets him arrested in two seconds! Didn’t even get to ask his frakking name! Then go ask her what's up, and she brushes me off!*

Rien punctuated his words with a kick to the station’s wall.

“Fuck!” That hurt. The pain helped him focus. Rien took a deep breath. “Calm down, Rien. Steady hands, just like Luci taught you.”

He looked around, adjusting his eyes to the lower levels of light. The tram ran all throughout the city, including the upper levels, so the cabins were well lit. But here, down in the Grid, it was a different story. The station had no roof. It was a single, long slab of rockrete, lit by a strip of cold, flickering lights. The lack of shelter wasn’t usually a problem during the day – rush hour brought in more than enough people to fight off even the harshest of mornings – but right now Rien was feeling the winter cold soak to his bones. Still, he thanked the Empire that nobody was in the station to see his outburst.

With a slight limp to avoid overbearing his toe, Rien headed towards one of the metallic bridges that connected the station with the lumbering mass of the Grid. As his boots clanged their way across the platform, he saw that one of the guardrails was broken. Rien wondered if it was the result of some poor soul falling. It was a long way down from Level 190, West Cuadrant.

*Huh. I wonder how long that’s been there. They should get that fixed.*

Then he stopped, and chuckled. He had spent too much time uptown, we was turning posh. He shook his head, continuing towards the sea of lights that was his block.

As he approached the giant wall of habs, he started looking for the usual faces in the usual spots. The Grids were usually quiet at night, but one could still see the facade peppered with small lights coming from small windows on the hab doors. In fact, from where Rien was, one could see almost everything happening outside of the cramped prefabs: The small groups of people quietly sharing a smoke and the news of the day. The people marching to the communal bathrooms, looking for late night relief. Teenagers, sneaking out to meet with their friends or lovers.

People here didn’t have much, but Rien felt more at home than he had all day, pursuing the madman through the upper levels. Even the smog felt easier to breathe somehow.

Rien was pondering this as he made his way up the stairs to his hab in Level 209, when a familiar voice called his name.

“Hey, kid! What’cha up to, this late at night?”

Rien looked to his right. Lucitav was making signs from his chair. Rien approached the old man, smiling.

“Not much, Luci. Just went up to see the sky is all” Lucitav wouldn’t buy today’s excuse either, and Rien knew that already. He’d even made a game out of it, every night trying to come up with a wilder reason than the last. Luci wasn’t smiling.

“You know I don’t like you messing with the upper crusters. No good can come out of it. You should focus on doing good at the shop, and leave the big problems for the big wigs.” That speech, on the other hand, didn’t change at all from night to night.

“Don’t worry old man, I can cover my ass.” *It’s not like I have a choice, anyway*.

“Don’t call me old man, you snote!” He wasn’t really that old, barely hitting 40. But 40 years were a long time in the Grids, and more for someone with Lucitav’s life. Plus, Rien loved to tease him about it. “You better be right about covering your ass, otherwise you’ll end up like… like…”

Lucitav lowered his voice, and then his eyes. Rien felt a pang of guilt in the chest for picking on the man. *Like Marsha*, he thought. A silence fell on the balcony and they both looked outside, to the cascade of lights that was Decorat’s nightlife, letting the seconds pass. Remembering.

“I’m sorry, Lucy. I’ll be careful, I promise.”

“You better be, kid. You better be.” Said Lucitav, his eyes still fixed on the millions of lights before them. “I’m tired, I’m going to bed. You have a good night, and tell your sister I say hi.” He said. He got up, using his crutches to make up for his missing right leg. The door to his hab slid open with a hiss and a clang, and the broken man limped inside.

“Good night, *old man*” Rien said, trying to lighten the mood.

Lucitav chuckled drily, and the door to his hab slid closed.

Rien climbed two more floors and walked left until he got to Hab Block 1337, Level 209. *Home*. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what came next.

Fortunately, she was still sleeping when the hab door slid open. Rien entered the hab, quietly taking his boots off. He moved sideways, feeling the cold rockrete in the space between their bed and the left wall. He was so focused on stealth that his left foot bumped on the chair, dropping some of her medicine bottles to the floor with a loud thud.

“Shit!” He exclaimed, pain flaring from his toes up his calf. That was the foot he’d stubbed earlier. Cel groaned, stirred and turned, taking the bedsheets with her. Heart pounding, Rien stood perfectly still, counting to ten.

Trying not to make a sound that would disturb his sister’s peace, Rien bent over to pick up the fallen vial. *Thank the Empire, it’s still intact.* Rien thought. The last thing he needed was to have to go buy another dose. One last look at Cel told him that it was probably safe to move again, and he started making his way towards the sink, this time looking at where he was going.

Rien let out his breath when he finally got to the other end of the room, realizing that he had been holding it since the incident with the chair. He yawned, and started changing into his night clothes.

He hadn’t even removed his jacket when Cel sprung up, screaming.

“No! No, no! Get away!” screamed his sister, as she sat upright, covering her face with her hands.

Rien rushed to her side.

“Shh, Cel. It’s me, I’m here” He said, putting his arms around her shoulders. Rien could feel her sister’s cold sweat on her warm skin, and — most worrying of all — her heart pumping wildly.

“Get away!” Cel’s hands were waving wildly in the air now fighting an invisible foe. Her eyes were wide open, bloodshot, looking with fear at something that wasn’t there. Rien held her tighter. Cel was older and stronger than him, but he refused to let go.

“It’s me, Cel. It’s Rien. You’re safe, you’re with me”.

Seconds passed, then minutes. Eventually, slowly, Rien started feeling Cel’s body relax. Her eyes started coming into focus, and her breathing became more regular.

“Is it… you, Rien?” Her voice was a whisper.

“I’m here, Cel.” Rien let go of his sister and sat beside her on the unmade bed, giving her space to breath.

“I’ve had another dream.” She said. She was on the brink of tears.

“Yeah…” That wasn’t what Cel needed to hear, but it was the best Rien could do right now. His eyes fixed on the tiny patch of uncluttered space left on the floor of the hab. The nightmares were getting worse, and they came more frequently now. He didn’t know how much longer Cel could keep this up. Damn, *he* didn’t know how long *he* would be able to keep it up.

Cel looked at him, and her expression changed instantly. She wiped her eyes with her arm and sprang up the bed, making the rusty springs creak.

“Terra! You must be hungry, Ry!” she said in a cheerful tone. “Let me make us some dinner. What do you say to a couple of bricks?”

Rien didn’t really know what the carb-bricks were made of, but he started feeling better when Cel started frying a cuple on the small stovetop. He hadn’t realized how hungry he was until the smell started filling the room, but now his stomach was rumbling.

Cel turned around shortly, two steaming plated in hand. “Make some room, will you?”

Rien sprang into action. He cleared the chair moving the medicine to the small shelf above the bed, made the bed and sat down, all in a matter of seconds. Cel passed him a plate, and they started eating.

“What were you doing out so late, anyway?” said Cel after a while.

“Following that ninker from the other day.” said Rien. Bits of brick jumped out of his mouth “I —”

“Don’t talk with your mouth full, Ry” said Cel without lifting her gaze off her plate.

“— Sorry” Rien gulped. “I followed him all the way uptown, to the port, but he started making a scene, and this lady knocked right out. She looked military, but she was dressed all fancy. I think she was a noble or something. She wasn’t afraid of the Enforcers.”

“Wait, back up. You went to the upper levels? To the port?”

“Yeah”

“Ry, were you careful?” she said, with more than a note of worry in her voice.

“Well, I think I was. I don’t think anyone saw me. Maybe her cat?”

“Her cat?” Cel turned to him, interested.

“Yeah, she had a cat some neat augmetics. That lady has money, I tell you. I was scared for a moment there, but she wasn’t interested in a Gridder like me.”

“Huh. Fancy that.” Cel went back to her plate and continued eating. “And then what happened?”

“Then I came back! I saw old Lucy on his chair, he gave me the usual speech”

“He’s right, you know.” said Cel, putting down her empty plate and looking at Rien. “I don’t like these escapades either. I’m worried about you.”

“Well, we don’t have a better plan” Rien shrugged. “Until we know what’s going on with you, I’m going to keep looking. You didn’t see how that man was, but I’m not letting you go nuts like that.” Rien looked at Cel. Something she saw in his eyes made her expression soften.

“I’m sorry to put you through this, brother.”

“That’s okay” said Rien, with all the sincerity his tired face could muster. “you’d do the same for me”.

Rien got up and picked the plates, making Cel understand that he was done talking about it.

“You better get some rest” he said, signalling the bed.

“Leave that, I’ll wash it tomorrow” said Cel, lying on the bed.

“Don’t worry, I got it” said Rien, dropping the dishes in the sink.

“Okay, suit yourself.” Cel was half asleep already.

When he was done washing the dishes, Rien reached up to the shelf, looking for the small vial. His shoulders sunk as he collapsed on the chair, exhausted.

He loaded the needle with the sedative, and he went to sleep hoping he wouldn’t have to use it that night.

# Spires

Erika looked at the great, closed door in front of her. It was entirely made of wood, real wood, with Sagitar Corp’s insignia etched in each of the leaves.

She was dressed in a white two-piece suit, with the only accessories being her house’s insignia enbroidered on the left breastpocket and her military accolades on the right. Her outfit was spotless as usual, but Erika noticed that she had lost some weight. The synthsilk jacket was a little bit baggier than she remembered. Military rations weren’t the most nutritive of meals.

She pushed these thoughts away as she listened to the other side of the door. The Sagitar Planet Management Council were meeting to discuss the Data Entry Rites scheduled to happen in a few weeks.

“… There’s simply not enough money, Li. It cannot be done.” She heard a deep, male voice say on the other side.

“Then raise prices, Lobos. You more than anyone know how much this planet depends on the Rites.” Another voice said, this time female. There was a very obvious frustration in that voice. “This year’s data shipment will double last year’s. *Double!* If we don’t expand the data-docks, the fuel expenses alone will eat up all the profits! Dana, back me up here, please?”

“Well, I think —” Started a third, Dana, a very high-pitched female voice.

“And who is going to buy, Li?” Lobos interrupted her, now also sounding frustrated. “We’re already gauging the eyes out of everyone in this city. They buy our food, they take it to our houses, and cook it with our energy. We even bought the Fingers so they die in our hospitals!”

“I have to agree with Lobos on this one, Li” Dana said.

“Thank you!” Said Lobos, interrupting. “Finally somebody else understands that two plus two is four”

“Let me speak.” Dana seemed calm, but Lobos didn't interrupt this time. “The biggest problem is the rate of disappearances. We have lost a few hundred thousand more people than expected this quarter. What Lobos is trying to explain is that it’s really eaten into our profits.”

A fourth voice started speaking, and Erika identified it as Markov.

“Dear colleagues. You are all correct in your assessments. Li, you’re right that we need to expand the stardock if we hope to have a profit at the end of the rights. Lobos and Dana, you’re right that we cannot accomplish that if there’s less people to sell things to.” Markov’s voice was calm and reassuring. “However, we still have options. Erika, would you please come in?”

At that mention, the great wooden gates started to creak open, revealing the council room.

The only furniture was a large, round mahogany table. The four council members were sitting in high-back thrones spread around evenly across its circumference. Erika couldn’t make out their faces, as the warm evening sun bursted through the glass wall at the end of the room, enveloping the chancellors in shadow.

Erika straightened her jacket one last time, and stepped in.

“Fellow council members, this is Erika Belcroft. She will help us find our missing customers.” Nabokov said, raising his arm towards the approaching Erika.

As she approached, the soles of her boots resonated on the marble tiles. The three council members fell silent. Now that she was closer, Erika could distinguish her faces. She saw a mixture of interest and contempt in their eyes. Erika held their gaze, defiant.

Lobos was the first to speak.

“This is what you have, Markov? A military officer?” He looked like a man in his early forties, with a whitening but well-kept beard and a blue suit. He also looked angry. "And a low rank, nonetheless. Are you out of your mind?"

“We finally agree on something, Lobos.” The voice belonged to Li. Erika saw a woman, apparently in her late fifties, dressed in a one-piece green silk dress that crossed across her breast. She was sitting with her back straight, and the only movement in her body were her lips. If Erika hadn’t heard her outburst before, she would have sworn the woman was as cold as ice.

“Dunno, I kind of like her” Said another chancellor, amused. She was sitting back in her throne, one leg raised and resting on one of the armrests. Erika identified her as Dana. She was a petite woman, and didn’t look more than twenty. Of course, Erika knew better than to trust that someone in this position would actually _be_ the age they looked. Rejuv treatments were commonplace among the elite. She was probably much, much older than her.

Markov ignored them, and turned to Erika.

“Thank you for coming, mamzel Belcroft. Let me make proper introductions. The man who seems so displeased with you is Tax and Revenue Chancellor Simon Lobos. The woman sitting so still next to him is Zhu Li, our Infrastructure Chancellor. You, like everyone in a twenty mile radius, have no doubt heard them argue about the Rites.” He shot a severe look at them, and they somehow seemed to recoil “And this lovely lady is Population Chancellor Dana Atsuki, the voice of reason.” The young chancellor waved at Erika.

“Now that we all know each other, we can talk business.” Markov continued. “Mamzel Belcroft here is no common line officer. She studied in the Academy, here in Decorat, where she consistently excelled in intelligence gathering and covert assault. I’ve been following her career, and she has racked up an impressive resume, both on and off the field. We all want to find the missing people, and she’s going to help us do that.”

“That all sounds good, but the Academy spits out thousands of exceptional people every year.” Lobos had calmed down, but he still seemed distrustful. “Be honest with us, Boris. Why bring someone in from the frontlines?”

Erika stared at Lobos. She didn’t like someone challenging her abilities so openly.

“You’re not all gone after all, Simon. You’re right, we have many like her. It’s precisely *because* she’s been in the frontlines for so long. We have screened her communication logs, and she hasn’t been in touch with anyone in the planet for decades. I’m sure she has no connection with the disappearances which, honestly, is more than I can say about you three.”

Lobos thought for a second, and then shrugged and nodded “That’s fair.”

“Furthermore, she’s motivated. Her father is among the disappeared.”

For a split second, Zhu Li’s lips betrayed a tight smile “Well done, Boris. Now, next time, please tell us before we waste our time arguing, will you?”

“Ah, but where’s the fun in that?” Markov winked at Erika. Erika smirked lightly.

She didn’t like the man, or any of the other chancellors, but she appreciated the display of leadership skill. He had probably instigated the discussion himself, all in order to bring her as the solution to the problem. There was a reason he practically ruled the planet.

Heavy footsteps sounded behind Erika. When she turned to look, she saw a tower of a man approaching the table. His plain white was splotched with stains, and his balding head shone with beads of sweat.

“Right on time, Mr. Boch!” Markov said. Erika considered the perfect timing of the new arrival. Somehow, she didn’t believe it was a coincidence “Erika, this is Damian Boch, one of our chiefs of security. If you please follow him, he will provide you with the people and resources you’ll need.”

“I don’t want any men. I work alone.” Erika said, a bit more strongly than she’d hoped. She felt overpowered and disrespected, and that put her on edge.

“Just as well.” Markov said, unmoved. “Just remember what’s a stake. Mr Boch, please escort mamzel Belcroft outside, and brief her on the details. We have other matters to discuss.”

“Of course, sir” Said the man, wheezing. He turned to leave, Erika followed.

The wooden gates closed as she exited the room, but Erika could still hear Lobos.

“… and she is expendable. If she ends up dead in a ditch, this won’t come back to us”.

Somehow, that didn’t surprise her.

---

“That’s a nice piece you got there. What is it, a Montesco?”

Chief Boch said this over his shoulder, or at least tried to. His mass pressed Erika to the elevator wall, and she could see how his neck muscles prevented him from turning his head. Still, Erika appreciated someone who knew their way around a cane-sword.

“Thank you, and yes”, She said, unsheathing the blad hiding in her cane a couple of centimetres. She turned it on, and the air suddenly filled with the buzz of ozone. “It’s a family heirloom, my grandfather had it made. 1.5 meters, galvanic core. Hasn’t failed me yet.”

“I wish they gave us that kind of kit” Boch seemed genuinely hopeful. “All we get are solid slug guns and batons, none of that military issue las-stuff” Boch looked at the flight marker in the elevator, daydreaming.

Erika smiled, grateful that he wasn’t able to see her. *You don’t need that “las-stuff” to control drunk civilians*, she thought. What’s the worst that one could face so far from the frontlines?

The elevator dinged, and the doors gave way to a much less extravagantly decorated hallway. Plain off-white plaster walls formed a hallway lined with same-looking office doors.

Boch exited the elevator, directed her to one of them. Erika took that moment to stretch herself after being cooped up for what seemed an eternity.

The inside of Boch’s office was as unimpressive as the outside. A single table, a single screen, a single cup of burnt caffeine, and a few piles of unread dataslates. Boch took a seat behind his desk, and directed Erika to do the same.

“So. Erika Belcroft, is it?” He said, picking a dataslate and wiping the caffeine splashes from it. “Major of the 154th Decoratian Expansion Corps. That right?”

Erika nodded.

“All right. I don’t know why the bosses brought *you* here. To be honest, I don’t care. But hey, they’ve told me to give you a hand.”

“I don’t need your —”

“Don’t care.” He cut her off. “Big bosses tell me yo give you a hand, I give you a hand. And you should take it too, if you know what’s good for you. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner you can go do whatever you want.” He wasn’t even looking at her, he was slurping his caffeine.

“Here’s the deal. People have been dissappearing, big time. More than usual, and that’s hurting the bosses. My people are busy patrolling the spires, and making sure everything is tip-top for the big procession, so they need you to find them.” Sagitar had tens of thousands of security personnel in Decorat, and Erika doubted that they needed all of them for “preparations”.

“I knew that alread —“

“Again, miss. I have to go through this, whether we like it or not. The sooner you let me finish, the sooner I can go back to my job. We have only been able to establish a single thread. The *TruJoi* club, a PleaseCog place down in Pleasure Level 157. You have your father to thank for that, we’ve only made that connection because the boss told us to look into him. He used to frequent it. If I were you, I’d start from there.”

Erika was genuinely shocked. “How do you know my father was frequenting that club?” Her father, in one of those crapholes…

“That I cannot tell you, but I was hoping it was rather obvious.” He didn’t seem phased at all, like this was all business as usual. “That’s all I got.” He said, and sat back, sipping his caffeine. “Now piss off.”

As Erika was getting up to leave, he remembered something. He rummaged in his drawers for a bit “Almost forgot. The bosses also told me to give you this” He handed her a shiny plastek card with the Sagitar logo and her biodata on it. “That’s clearance, a *free pass* if you will. Use it if things get ugly. Now that’s it. Go, I have work to do.”

Erika wasn’t convinced of that last statement, but she picked up the pass and left anyway.

# Descent

“Decorat is great for many reasons, Tristan” Erika told the cat curled up in the passenger seat of her grav-car. “But The Grids aren’t one of them.”

From the crystal windows of the flier’s cabin, they could see the translucent miasma approaching them, signaling their entrance into the lower hive. Down there, the recycled air was mixed with exhaust from the cooling systems that kept the Archive’s underground vault running. It was technically breathable, but not by much.

Not many people below the Great Archive had the luxury of fliers, so the sky was empty, and Erika had no problem following the mag-tram’s tracks downhill. As she entered the cloud of smog, she could see the top of the gigant pile of hab-blocks that formed the Grid. While every hab in the Grid fit perfectly with its neighbours, the Grid – like Decorat’s population – was ever expanding. When one of the blocks malfunctioned, it was often easiest to stack a new one on top. This meant that new blocks were constantly being added to the top of the building, and the population as a whole moved steadily upward.

*Some day*, she thought, *they will build the towers so tall that they will rise above the smog.* Judging by the current state of things, however, that wouldn’t happen for a few thousand years.

It also meant that Erika had no place to land her flier. The top of the building was covered in half-built blocks, and she refused squarely to get to ground level. Not even the Gridders themselves went to that abandoned carcass of old habs.

Erika cursed her luck. *This is what I get for coming down to this dump.*

She would have to be quick, and leave the engine running. She sighed, and started descending into the mountains of concrete, searching for *The TruJoi*.

She found it in one of the Pleasure Levels. The flier stopped, suspended above a drop a hundred levels deep, and the driver’s door hissed open. It was a long way down, but Erika had seen worse.

She leapt across the chasm into the steel sidewalk, and breathed in.

Or, rather, she tried to. Down there, the thick air slid down one’s throat like warm honey. She doubled over coughing for a few seconds, while her lungs accustomed to the heavy smog. She couldn’t wait to get out of there.

*It’s not just the air*, she thought, looking at the neon lights trying to attract all the poor devils that came here in search of relief and oblivion. *Even in off hours, this place stinks of sweat and excess.*

Tristan’s legs clanged loudly when he leapt beside her.

“Let’s go, dear.” She said, pulling the clearance badge that Boch had given her “the sooner we are done with this, the sooner we can get out”

---

The *TruJoi’s* façade was the same as the dozes of PleaseCog bars on the street: Neon silhouette holograms of naked people with bright-colored skin invited people to go through the dimly lit threshold covered by opaque plastik curtains.

As Erika approached, a sweaty mass tumbled outside. A man, dressed in low-level Cognitor operator clothes, smelling of rank sweat and even ranker liquor, smiling as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Erika managed to avoid him and keep her clothes clean.

“This is what a fallen person looks like, Tristan. Instead of doing something with their lives, they waste them here.” As she pushed the curtain, she wondered again why her father had come to one of these places.

Inside, a clerk was smiling behind a small plastek counter. He was dressed in the colorful plastek suits that Gridders considered fancy.

“A pod for one, mamzel? We have a few fresh memories that may suit someone such as yourself.” He waved a hand over the counter, and several hologram silhouettes appeared, performing a variety of sexual activities, some of which Erika had never thought possible.

“That’s not what I’m looking fo—”

“Oh, I see!” The clerk answered quickly, and his eyes widened. “Apologies, madam. I should have guessed.” He glanced at Tristan. “Perhaps something more… exotic?”

He started waving his hand, but Erika did not want to see what was going to show. She grabbed him by the wrist.

“Cut the crap.” She slammed her fist on the desk, squashing one of the holograms. The clerk’s face sobered. “I’m not here for a good time. I’m here to answer some questions. I’m looking for Jordan Belcroft. He’s a client. Do you know him?”

“Ah. I’m afraid I can’t answer that, mamzel. The *TruJoi* prides itself on its discretion.”

“Ha! A pit like this? Alright, let’s play that way.” She pulled the clearance sheet from her longcoat. “How about now? Can you tell me now?”

The clerk examined the card for a moment. He didn’t seem happy, but he seemed to recognize the Corporation’s insignia. His eyes locked into Erika’s he pulled his wrist free from her grasp.

“That seems official, indeed. I need to verify with my manager, and that can take a while.” He tapped some symbols in his terminal, and handed Erika a pink hexagonal piece of plastic with the number 18 written in white letters. “Here. Please wait in pod 18, you’re scaring away the customers. It’s right down the hall.”

He waved behind him, towards a staircase that seemed to descend into a pit of dim magenta light.

---

Erika stepped down the stairs. Her eyes adjusted to the low purple right instantly, and she could see a long passageway, surrounded by cylindrical plastek tubes on either side. The tubes were wide enough to fit a handful of people, but each of them contained a single seat.

Erika felt the sticky floor as she made her way down the hall. At this hour, most of the PleaseCog pods were empty, and their doors doors were open. Inside each of the cubicles, a single plas-leather armchair occupied most of the space. A helmet, with several cables connecting it to the chair, lay on a hook on top of the headrest.

The air was heavier and the light was dimmer as she approached the end of the hallway. She passed a pod in use, its door closed.

“Hi-hi! Yes, that’s right dear.” A playful voice laughed from the other side.

*Such an invention, a marvel of engineering, used for… this.* She thought, as she made her way down the pods.

Erika felt repulsed by the mere concept of PleaseCogs. These machines, Cognitors, allowed humans to search and relive vast arrays of data by replaying it in their conscious minds. They were designed to support the Great Archive, where queries were distributed across hundreds of Cognitors who dug through millenia of data.

Here, they had a very different purpose. These machines had been corrupted in their purpose. They connected to custom databanks of illicit memories. People here weren’t serving any higher purpose, they were looking for an experience, a fantasy. People came here to waste their lives.

The next pod was also in use, but no laughter came out of it. Instead, Erika heard a series of violent thuds and low moans of pain. She didn’t want to know what memory was being relived. Tristan noticed it too, and he hissed at the door.

Finally, she made it to the end of the hallway. It was dead quiet here, not even the air seemed to have moved in the last week. Pod 18 was standing right in front of her, surrounded by two other closed pods.

As Erika opened it, she realized something. It was dead quiet. *It’s a trap.*

The doors of the surrounding pods slammed open, and two shapes came at her. That split second realization gave her the headway she needed to avoid the first hit, but something blunt hit her in the right arm as she rolled into Pod 18, sending ripples of pain through her arm.

Erika groaned, and turned to face the assailants. A man and a woman, both strong, both wielding riot batons, were coming at her for a second blow. It was a constrained space, so Erika couldn’t unsheathe her weapons. She’d have to get creative.

Erika grabbed the interface of the PleaseCog with her left hand. At her signal, Tristan launched himself to the woman’s face, as Erika tossed the heavy metal helmet to the man.

The assailants weren’t expecting that. The woman stumbled and fell under the weight of the augmented animal, but the man managed to dodge the projectile.

*Crap, now I have to actually do this with just one good arm*.

She dashed towards the man, raising her left fist for a punch. She was not as strong as him, and they both knew it. The man smiled, and raised the baton to deflect the punch.

In the last second, Erika used her momentum to dive and slide past the man, much to his surprise. She sprang up behind him, and delivered the same expert blow that had knocked out the man in the starport.

The goon’s unconscious body fell to the floor with a quiet *thud*.

Erika turned her attention to the woman, who was still trying to wrestle Tristan out of her face. Erika walked up to her, and placed a knee on her chest, pinning her down to the floor.

“Who sent you?” She asked. The woman’s answer was muffled by Tristan’s fur. “Tristan, dear. Please let her speak” The cat stared at her, and moved away reluctantly. “Now, I won’t ask again. Who sent you?”

“Go to hell.” The woman answered.

“Okay, fair enough. I can respect that” Erika said. Right before knocking her out. “But I can’t have you following me either.”

Erika examined her right hand. It was probably broken. It was about to turn personal with these people, now she had something else to settle.

She stormed up the stairs, and grabbed the clerk by the collar.

“You! Do you know what trouble you’ve just gotten you boss into? You do know what this is, right?” She asked, shoving the clearance card on his face.

“Of course!” Said the clerk, his face smiling despite it being pushed against the counter. “The question is, do _you_ know? I encourage you to contact your boss, and really figure out the worth of that license, before you barge in here asking questions again.”

He seemed too confident for a man who just had two of his goons knocked out. Erika was starting to think he was right.

“… I do hope you have enjoyed our appetizer service. If you’d like to stay, the main is about to arrive.” Reluctantly, Erika released the man, and he straightened his clothes. “That’s what I thought.”

Erika groaned, and made for the door. As she was about to reach for the courtains, she heard the snarky voice of the clerk behind her.

“Thank you, come again!”

It took all of her willpower to keep walking out and leave the smug clerk behind. Somebody would pay for her hand. Her father was probably never been there in the first place. She had some questions to ask Boch.

---

The light of a newsglobe zooming overhead blinded Rien momentarily.

"*Thank you for doing your part in keeping the Grand Archive running. Enjoy your celebration. The Sagitar Corporation values you, very much"* Blasted the tinny speakers of the aircraft.

Standing before the *Interchange*, Rien looked around, at the nightlife swirling through the streets of the Pleasure Level 185.

Thousands of people dressed in colorful plastek suits crossed the bridges that connected the bars and clubs of this level. They hopped from one to the other, attracted to the neon lights like moths. Despite the blinding lights, Rien couldn’t help but notice how the this level seemed more menacing than the hab blocks further up the Grid. It was hard to put a finger on it, but something in the looming towers of ads for cheap thrills made him feel on edge.

For the poor people of Decorat, the Pleasure Levels were an escape valve. And an escape valve were loud and aggressive.

He almost lost balance and fell when somebody bumped his shoulder. A loud crash made him realize that he had knocked down somebody’s bottle.

“S-scuse me! You gonna pay for that, you little shit?” said the woman, as Rien turned.

Her two-piece orange and purple outfit was torn and dirty in places. She had dyed her hair electric blue, and was very clearly about to get a kick of Druema, the cheap drug that flowed freely in the fleshy currents of the Pleasure Level crowd.

Realizing the state of the woman, Rien ignored her.

“Oi! I’m’s talkin’ to yo—” The woman didn’t get to finish her sentence. The Druema kicked in, her pupils dilated, and her expression became a lot more friendly. The strong opioid did that to people. “Nevermind…” said the woman with a big, friendly smile. Deep in a sea of pleasant thoughts, she started waddling to a bar down the street.

Rien focused on his goal. They had run out of sedatives, and the *Interchange* was the only place he would be able to get a refill. Despite the ominous name,  the place was little more than a hole punched on an old hab-block. An old woman in a plain gray coat worked behind a small metallic counter where Druema — and other, harder substances — regularly exchanged hands. She was visibly balding, and she was reading volume 249 of an erotic zine. The only thing that set *The Interchange* apart from all other dispensaries was that Rien didn’t have a tab with them… yet.

*Well, here goes nothing* He told himself, stepping up to the shopkeeper.

“Good night!” He said, with the most sincere smile he could.

“Good, bad, all nights are the same, boy. What do you want? I’m busy here.” she said, putting the dataslate down.

“I need something for the pain.” Rien said.

“You’ll need to be more specific, boy.” If she had any patience left in her reserve, it was quickly dwindling. “Druema? Anix? Ditrix? C’mon!”

“No, no. Something stronger.” Rien leaned in closer, and whispered “Something for the Shivers.”

“Ha! That’s going to cost you. Two thousand credits for five vials.”

“Two thousand!” Rien was genuinely shocked “that’s double what they charge at the Medic Ward!”

“Well, if you could get the official stuff, we wouldn’t be talking, now would we boy?” She said with a sly smile. She was right. She had got him.

“Fine.” Rien said with a sigh. “Will you at least give me credit? I don’t have the cash with me right now.”

Rien mentally crossed his fingers. He didn’t have a way to repay the credit, but he also needed the medicine.

The woman stood there, examining him intently. As he felt the mass of tall, sweaty, drunk adults shuffling against his back, Rien felt very small.

Suddenly, Rien heard a sharp hiss and a wet crunch coming from inside of *The Interchange.* A blood-curding scream of agony followed a second later.

The woman saw the expression in Rien’s face and smiled a crooked, wicked smile.

“Of course we can extend credit. But don’t forget to pay on time. Two thousand plus interest, that’s… yeah, three grand. Have it ready for next week, or… well, you heard.”

Rien swallowed audibly. Three thousand credits. He had no idea how to get that much. But his sister couldn't sleep without the drugs, and this was the only option left.

In less than two minutes, they had signed the credit contract, and five clear vials of tranquilizers had exchanged hands.

Rien walked away, back to his hab, terrified. At some point, they would try to claim the debt, they would realize that he had no money, and Rien would be in real trouble.

But that was later, and his sister needed the him now.

# The Law

Erika squirmed with pain.

“Please, mamzel, try not to move so much.” Olin said, visibly trying to contain a laugh.

Sitting on the tall armchair, having her hand worked on by a servo, Erika wasn’t amused.

“Is this funny to you, Olin?” She asked, with another wince of pain. The pale flesh of the cyborg torso’s arm had pinched her. She couldn’t believe it, but she realised she missed the battlefield med-servos.

“Of course not, mamzel.” The corners of his mouth were starting to curve upwards “But please remind me one more time what that clerk told you on your way out.” His attempt at containment failed, and he burst out a chuckle. “Mamzel, you should really inform yourself on the proper etiquette before going somewhere.”

“Leave. It. Be. and please call for some caffeine.” Erika snapped. An alert appeared in her eye augment. An incoming communication request, from Boch. She blinked, and the image of the security chief projected into the middle of the room.

“Damian, I was about to call you. What is this crap clearance you’ve given me? I just got assaulted by a couple of lowlifes down in the Grid.”

“'evening to you too.” He said, looking worried “That’s why I call.”

“And too long it has taken you! They’ve busted up my arm, you should have the whole place decomissioned!”

“Ha!” That was the first time Erika had seen Boch smile “You got it all wrong, Belcroft. I’ve received word that you’ve been stirring up trouble. You need to cut that out, now. Be more tactful next time.”

“More tactful! They weren’t tactful when they broke my damn hand!” She scoffed and pulled the card out of her coat. “You told me this clearance meant something!”

“To the Enforcers! That card is Sagitar official clearance, which means you won’t get arrested by Enforcers. The company can’t help if you get yourself killed because you assaulted a gang PleaseCog bar.”

Erika couldn’t believe her ears “You could have said that sooner, you know. I’m a Major of the Expansion Corps, I don’t need protection from *Enforcers.*”

“And I’m busy with my real work, and don’t give a shit. Whatever. In fact, you don’t want to stir anything up with the gangs. It’s an open secret that the company makes a lot of money selling them Druema and used Cognitors. If it comes to you or the gangs, believe me, it’s not *them* that will end up in a freezer.”

Erika slammed her fist againtst the armchair, which sent a whip of pain through her forearm. Olin’s smile widened. She decided missed the straightforwardness of the battlefield. There, your enemies were always in front of you.

“Well then how do you propose I find anything out, if I can’t ask?”

“Not my problem, Belcroft. But you better do something, quick. Also, you should go see that Enforcer you had a run-in with at the starport. You didn’t have clearance then, you’re witness to a case.”

“I know, Boch. Anything else you haven’t told me?”

“No, that’s all. Don’t take it out on me, Belcroft. I’m just the messenger.” He said, and he hung up.

Erika sighed, and rubbed her temple. “This just keeps getting better and better. What are you still smiling at, Olin?”

“Nothing, mamzel. I’ll get the caffeine ready.”

He was still grinning when he came back with the steaming cup.

---

Enforcer Vanya Minsk yawned, sipped her caffeine, and went back to typing. Her desk, full of last night’s paperwork, was just one of the hundreds of identical tables covering the fifth floor of the Enforcer headquarters. But she had chosen the position very carefully.

From her vantage point at the end of the room, she had seen that Belcroft storm into the office. She had also seen how she talked with reception, and they pointed her towards her desk.

Now, she had time to prepare her questions, and dispatch that pompous brut as quickly as possible.

“Let’s make this quick, agent.” said Erika, as she sat down on the worn plastek chair. She was obviously not in a good mood. Vanya lifted her eyes from the mountain of papers she was handling, and tried very hard to remove the frown from her eyebrows.

She took a moment to read her witness.

*Long, gray stormcoat, military. House insignia etched on the breastpocket, officer chevrons. Standard issue laspistol, and – is that a cane? definitely not standard issue. Must be a family heirloom.*

"I agree. Let’s make this quick." Neither of them wanted this to be longer than it needed to be. *At least she hasn’t brought the cat.*

Vanya rummaged around one of her drawers. Where was the damn thing? She could almost feel that ninker’s eyes rolling.

A few seconds later, she placed a small, rectangular voxcorder on the table.

“For record keeping.” She clarified as she turned it on. “Please state your name.”

“Erika Belcroft.”

“Where were you two nights ago?”

“I was in the Decorat starport, just arriving from recall.”

“What brings you back, mamzel Belcroft?”

“I don’t think that’s relevant.” Erika answered curtly.

*That’s interesting*, thought Vanya. *She’s hiding something.* She pressed a little further.

“I’m afraid it’s not you who decides that.”

The woman seared her with a furious look. Then she *smiled.*

“If you must know, I was here to see my father.”

“That’s odd. Not a lot of veterans come back just to see family. Must have been hard to pull the strings to get back”

“It was” she said. Her mouth was smiling, but her silence said *“keep asking, and I’ll show you first hand what strings I can pull.”*

Vanya wasn’t scared.

“Still, I can imagine it was an emergency of sorts. How is your father, mamzel Belcroft?”

*That hit a nerve,* Vanya thought. *Something tells me it has something to do with all these weird cases we’ve been getting lately.*

It only lasted for a second, though, and before long Erika’s face was back to that menacing stare.

“Alright, that’s enough” said Erika while she pulled something out of her coat. She handed it to Vanya. *Damn. A clearance from Sagitar. There’s definitely something going on here.*

But she couldn’t do anything against that license.

“Let’s go to more relevant questions. Can you describe the events in the starport?”

“I can.” Was all she said. *Oh, Sol,* Vanya thought. *Just what I needed. Now, she’s playing games*.

“Will you?”

“Sure! I arrived at the starport. I was trying to get to the grav-car rental, and this man was in the way. I tried to ask him to move, but he wouldn’t. Instead, he attacked me. I defended myself, and you know how it ended.”

What’s your relationship with Faustus Dorn?"

“Who?”

“The man you knocked out.”

“Ah. First impressions were a little rough, but I think we could grow to be friends. By the way, where is he now?”

“That’s no—” Erika tapped the clearance with a commanding finger. “Fine. He’s been dealt with. We have him on custody, and he will be put on ice once the investigation finalizes.”

“On ice? That’s practically a death sentence. Seems a little harsh for a minor public order incident.”

“We have strong reasons to believe that this individual is not acting alone, and that, left alone, would cause substantially more damage.”

“Still, seems excessive to condemn a man for something he hasn’t done”

Vanya was starting to get *very* annoyed. Who was this woman to question their methods? She clearly hadn’t seen what people like Faustus were capable of.

“We don’t have to explain ourselves to you, Belcroft. That’s not within the bounds of the clearance.”

Erika wasn’t paying attention to her. She was lost in thought.

“I think I’m going to need all the information you have on this Faustus. In particular, I’d like his address.”

"That’s private information about a citizen of the Solar Empire. It’s outside of our jurisdiction. You’ll have to go query the Archive, *like everyone else.*"

“But you have his information in one of these papers here, right?” In reality, the clearance *did* entitle Erika for that information. In fact, the Corporation should keep address records themselves. But, since apparently Belcoft wasn’t aware of that, she would have to go all the way to the Archive. Vanya took this as a personal victory.

Erika looked around her desk. Vanya was quick enough to snatch Faustus’s file before Erika had a chance to read it. Erika continued “Okay, message recieved. I’m getting bored. Anything else you need, Enforcer?”

*Yes,* Vanya thought *but with that clearance, you’re not going to give me anything, are you?*

Erika’s eyes responded *no, I’m not.* Vanya cleared her throat.

“Not for now, mamzel Belcroft. We will be in contact if we need anything else. In the meantime, please try not knocking anyone else down.”

Vanya stood up and reached out to shake Erika’s hand. Erika got up, ignored the hand, and started walking away.

---

Back in her flier, Erika was caressing Tristan's fur.

“You know, dear, I think I was a little too hard on that Enforcer. She was doing a good job. A pity we can’t work together, but like hell I’m going to let father go to the freezer.” Tristan purred in agreement.

“Now, there *is* something of value to rescue from this episode.” Erika blinked, and the augmetic in her eye started replaying an account of what had happened. “I’m not going to the Archive just for someone’s address.” She looked through the frames, searching for a precise moment.

“There.” She saw the Enforcer’s desk, full of papers, and spotted the one with Faustus’ information. “Now we just make it a bit bigger… there we have it! Hab 405, Level 169. Ugh, the Grids again. Well, Tristan, let’s go take a look.”

The gravcar lifted off, once more into the smog.

# Faustus

The seams of the grav-car’s doors hissed in a cloud of steam, and the passenger cabin popped open. Erika skipped to the chasis of her flier, hoping to not scratch the paint. When she looked down, she saw the great pit of nothing the grav-car was hovering over. Before her, across the railguard, there was a narrow passage connnecting all the living units. Beyond that passage, the stencil on the door indicated: Hab 405-NNC, Level 169.

“Let’s see what we find, shall we dear?” She hopped gracefully over the railguard, onto the passage. The cat followed suit.

The door was closed but, to Erika’s surprise, it had been left unlocked. The previous owner must have left in a hurry. “Well, Faustus, tell me your secrets” She said, pressing a button of the door’s console.

The door hissed open, and both woman and cat crossed it threshold. Erika looked around, and her jaw dropped.

She had seen many things. She had seen men die around her, cut down by alien beasts. Even before then, she had seen a thousand battles in the Academy’s training Cognitors. She had seen the horrors war had to offer.

She had never seen anything like that.

The walls, the ceiling, the floor… even the window was covered with tiny red letters, forming paragraphs upon paragraphs of incoherent blabber. There were lines where “I am” were the only words, repeated from one end of the wall to the other. Lines where Faustus was apparently talking to someone named Jorrick, asking him to stop showing him something.

By the time the scribbles reached the ceiling, only one name was legible amid the sea of half-written letters: Kyriel.

“Dear Sol”, she said, in awe. Not even in the most desperate of battles had Erika seen someone driven as mad as Faustus had. “What does this to a person?” She muttered, under her breath. A chilling thought crept through the back of her neck. This wasn’t Pod Disease, this was something worse. Something more… sinister. *Is this what awaits Father?*.

She did not dare say that one out loud.

Erika swallowed, and pushed the doubt out of her mind. She forced herself to focus, and took in the rest of the room. The entire hab took less space than her small closet. It could only be described as a narrow, short corridor of plascrete. A pile of dirty overalls covered what little space there was between the unmade bed and the filthy sink. Erika could swear there was a chair beneath all those red-stained shirts. The whole room smelled rank, like a towel that has been used too many times. The smoke of an unfinished tabac-stick fogged the window above the sink.

Erika paused.

A smoking tabac-stick.

She darted into action, moving herself to be flat against the door’s wall. She unholstered her lasgun and waved her head, and Tristan darted behind the pile of clothes, hiding. Erika waited for the owner of the tabac-stick to come back.

Still.

Expectant.

Not a minute later, a figure burst through the door. Erika didn’t waste a second. She grabbed it by the wrists and set her right foot forward at the same time. The figure lost balance and fell, face first, on the hard plascrete floor. She spun and dove, with the surgical precision of an expert combatant, pressing her knee on the back of the figure’s neck. She pointed her gun at the person’s head.

“Who are you and what are you doing here, quick.” Erika said.

“Wait! Don’t shoot! Are you crazy?” That voice was… young. A boy, a teenager. It sounded familiar.

“Answer the question, boy. Give me a reason not to shoot.”

“I’m the one that was following you! Remember? Last night? It was me! You knocked out my lead?” Said the boy. Erika remembered his terrible attempt at intimidation, and eased the pressure of his neck. “I’m here to warn you. They’re coming.”

“Who is?” Erika said.

A loud bang followed. She barely managed to duck in time to dodge the solid round. She felt a sharp pain in her right hand, and dropped her lasgun.

Erika rolled forward, taking cover behind the bed. In the blink of an eye, the sheath of her cane was flying across the room, and her power-rapier was humming in her hand. She saw Tristan still hiding behind the pile of clothes, and connected her augmetic eye to the cat’s.

There were three men standing between Erika and the door, dressed in lower-hive worker garbs. They were armed with long combat knives, and one of them was shooting at her with a stub gun. The other two were approaching the bed, encircling her.

Through Tristan’s eye, she saw the man adjust his aim, and shoot towards her crouching figure. The shots bounced off of the bed’s solid frame, lodging themselves in the brittle walls. Erika had seen this before, and knew how it ended. She disconnected from Tristan, and waited.

After a few more rounds, the man stopped to reload. Erika seized that window, springing from the bed and rushing him. She ducked, slipping below the knife of the first man, and lurched forward. Her sword buzzed as it penetrated the chest of the shooter and lodged on the wall behind him, filling the tiny room with the smell of burnt flesh.

She turned around without wasting a second, ready to strike down another one.

“Alright, let’s all calm down!” said the third man. He was using the boy as a human shield, and was holding a knife to his throat. Erika stopped her blade, inches from the man’s face. “Nobody has to get hurt, right Vince?”

“That’s right, Carl” said the other man.

“You should have thought of that before shooting” Erika said, nodding towards the body pinned to the wall.

“That’s probably true, but we got orders, you see. Now put the fancy glowknife out, or the boy gets it.”

Erika evaluated the situation. Despite their clothes, the men didn’t look like workers. She could see scars in their bare forearms and necks, and she could tell by their response to their compatriot’s demise that they were no stranger to death. These men were serious.

The boy, however, was another story. His face showed the stark surprise of someone who just realised they’re in over their head. He was staring at her, his eyes pleading for help.

“Go ahead, be my guest” Erika said, shrugging. The boy’s eyes opened in horror.

“No! Wait! I knew the man that lived here! I know why you’re here, I can help you!” he said.

*Now that’s interesting*, thought Erika. She looked at Carl, then Vince, and finally the boy, evaluating how much she trusted his word. She sighed. “Fine.” She powered off her sword, throwing it to the ground. “I yield.” She would have to do this the hard way.

Carl smiled. “That’s more like it. Now, on your knees.”

As Erika and the boy kneeled side by side, Carl picked up his tabac-stick from the sink, lighting it.

"Now. We find ourselves in a bit of a pickle, wouldn’t you say so, Vince?” Carl continued, going back to his fallen partner. He picked up the stub gun, and reloaded it with some rounds from the corpse. “You see, we were sent here to make sure that nobody could trace poor Faustus back to our boss. And here you both are, tracing Faustus back to our boss. Shouldn’t have done that." Carl aimed the gun at Erika. "So. What can we do now?"

Vince picked up Erika’s sword. “This is a fine piece ma’am.” he said, turning it on. *Bad mistake*, Erika thought, *shouldn’t have touched that*.

“Well, I’ve got some ideas.” Erika said. She made a head gesture, and Tristan’s augmetic legs propelled him across the room. Before he could react, Carl was hit by sixty pounds of steel and fur, toppling him to the floor. The gun’s threat removed, Erika tackled Vince, impaling him with her own sword. She turned to Carl. The man’s screams were mixed with a gurgling sound. Tristan’s adamantium claws had opened a deep gush in the man’s neck, and blood was pouring out onto the floor. Erika ended the man’s suffering with an expert cut.

As Carl’s last spasms died down, silence creeped into the hab-block. Erika turned to the boy. He was trembling, not quite sure how to react to what he had just seen. Erika remembered the first times she had seen death, during her trainings in the Academy, and almost took pity on him. She picked her weapons.

“Are you hurt?” She asked.

“No I’m… fine, I think.” The boy answered, eyes fixed on the mess of Carl’s neck.

“They would have killed us.” She said matter-of-factly.

“I know. There’s just so much… blood.”

“I suggest you look away, boy.” Her patience was wearing thin. “You said you could help me. Go on, then. Show me that I didn’t risk my neck for nothing.”

The boy shook his head, and stared at Erika. There was fear in his eyes. “I lied. I don’t know anything about this man. You got him arrested before I could even learn his name.” He lowered his eyes, not daring to look at Erika’s hardened stare. He was shaking from head to toe. “Please don’t kill me.”

Erika considered it. On the one hand, this boy had seen her, and could probably alert the authorities of what happened here. On the other hand, she had to admit that he had been pretty clever. She would have probably done something similar in his place, and she respected that. Plus, he probably had more to lose than her if he told the Enforcers. Erika sheathed her sword.

“I’m not going to kill you.” Tristan skipped over to her, and she pet his head. The boy looked at her, still tense. “I probably would have done the same. What’s your name, boy?”

“I’m Rien.”

“Get up, Rien.” The boy got up, regaining some measure of confidence. “You need to stop following me. I can’t have you pulling things like that, you’re going to get us both killed. What were you doing here, anyway?”

The boy hesitated. “You took out my lead. I had been following that man for a while, and you just go and get him arrested. And then you show up, in your fancy car, showing off all over the Grid. I thought maybe you knew something. I’d seen the men go in and out of this house, so I came in to warn you. I wasn’t following you… This time.”

Erika couldn’t help but smile. She definitely wouldn’t have done *that*. It was too foolhardy.

“That was a risky move, Rien. I could have killed you.”

“I… I know, ma’am. I just don’t have a choice, ma’am.” Rien looked straight into her eyes. Erika could see a fierce determination mixed with hope. “And judging by you coming down here to the Grids, I suspect that neither do you.”

Erika stared at him, realising what he was implying. *Poor boy*, she thought. She was sure that he also had someone… ill.

“I can’t help you.” She said. “I’m sorry.” The boy lowered his stare, and Erika could see he was holding in tears. “But here, take this.” She handed the boy a bar of credits “For your trouble.”

“I don’t want your money!” Rien snapped at her. “I want my sister back!” He said, tears running from his eyes. “Please, let me help you. I don’t know what to do anymore.”

Erika felt a ping of pain, but remained strong. “You would only hold me back, boy. I can’t do this if I have to worry about you getting hurt. I’m sorry for your sister. Go home, and pray for her recovery.”

Rien looked at her, hurt. Erika could hear him sobbing as he ran out of the room, splashing on the pooling blood.

Erika stood there, thinking for a moment. She didn’t feel good about leaving the boy behind, but it didn’t make it any less true. Whoever was behind this had sent three thugs like these to dispatch a crazy man’s house. One didn’t send that kind of force unless they had something big to hide.

That was no place for a boy.

The burning was slowly being replaced by the sickly sweet smell of death. Tristan miaowed, and she snapped out of her musings. That was still her only lead, so she had to make it count. Somebody must have heard the shots and alerted the Enforcers. She’d have to move quickly. Erika started inspecting the three bodies laid on the floor.

All three of them were muscular and well-built. Tatoos on their forearms identified them as military, and cheap prosthesis identified them as unfit for service. 53rd Decoratian Artillery, the few lucky ones that survived the Hyrum massacre. *How does one stoop so low? From serving the Empire in glorious battle to common street thug.*

Amid the hand-rolled tabac-sticks and the loose change, Erika found a small, hexagonal plastek piece in Vince’s pocket. The chipped paint was bright pink, and it had “Constanza’s” written in big cyan font. *Better than nothing.* Erika thought. She would have to figure out what this was.

She was storing the coin in her pocket as she exited the house, when she heard the Enforcer fliers approaching.

“Agent Minsk! How nice to see you again.” Erika said, as the familiar figure stepped out of the craft. “I know what this looks like, but I assure you that this was mere self-defense.” she added, when she saw the Enforcer’s face.

“That remains to be seen, Major.” Valya Minsk’s expression was equal proportions angry and upset, with a hint of impatience. “Because it sure doesn’t look like it.”

“Of course!” Erika said, in the most conciliatory tone she could manage. Enforcers couldn’t do anything to her, but this news would run fast. “I have it all recorded, if you’ll allow me.”

Erika tapped her left temple, and an image started projecting from her left eye. The Enforcers watched, astonished, as the whole fight — from Erika’s perspective — played out in front of them. All of them, except Minsk.

“So that’s how you got this lead, huh. In headquarters, with the implant?” Surprise and a little respect were added to her angry expression.

“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about” Erika answered.

“Yeah, sure you don’t.” She signalled the other Enforcers to start processing the scene. “That may have been self-defense, but that doesn’t explain what you were doing here in the first place.”

“I’m just a concerned citizen, agent.” Erika could see the frustration bubbling behind Minsk’s eyes. She felt a ping of regret. She was enjoying this too much. Under different circumstances, they could have been good friends. Of course, none of this showed on her face.

She jumped into the driver’s seat of her flier, ready to go. As she was waking the motors, an idea crossed Erika’s mind.

“I’m exhausted after all this. I think I’ll go to Constanza’s, and relax a little.” It was a gamble, but if she was right…

Minsk looked genuinely surprised now. “Constanza’s? What’s a brut like you have to do with a gang like that one? Didn’t peg you for the PleaseCog type.”

*Bingo.*

“Well, one has her weaknesses, I suppose.” Erika couldn’t help herself, and winked. As the pilot’s dome closed and they moved away from the Grid, Erika could see Minsk’s face as she realized what had happened.

*I shouldn’t have rubbed it in, that was very imprudent* She thought, as she raised back into clean air, on her way to the Archive. That name Kyriel meant something, and she would find out what.

# Shadow

In the dark corners of a troubled mind, two voices were talking.

“He got captured.” One of the voices said. A wet, throaty tone punctuated the remark.

“How is it that you couldn’t control him?” The second one asked. This sounded more natural, more… human.

“That’s none of your business.”

The second voice didn’t like that remark. “I thought we were together on this.”

There was stony silence for a few seconds. Then, the first voice returned.

“We are. Apologies…” It added, flatly. “There was a woman. Some official, from the Peacekeeping Corps. She cut the experiment short.”

A woman’s image materialized in the mind. She was middle-aged, somewhere between thirty and fifty years old. Her dark hair was neatly tied into a short ponytail. She wore military clothes, a tight-fitting gray waistcoat, and gray pants. The waistcoat’s tail flared as she moved around. She hadn’t drawn her standard issue gun, but she was brandishing a walking cane.

“You know her” Said the wet, gurgly voice. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes, I do.” The second voice paused for a second “Erika Belcroft…”

“Will she be a threat to the plan?”

The other voice thought for a second. Finally, it admitted “Possibly. I don’t know why she’s here, but we should be careful with her.”

“Let’s kill her.” The wet voice said that with a hungry tone that made the other voice uncomfortable.

“No! We’ve already talked about this. We’re not killing anyone.” Behind the finality of those words, both of them could feel the doubt and uncertainty.

The first voice didn’t respond, but rather let the hunger linger, overwhelming the corners of the shared mind. The hunger turned into urgency. A sense of being cornered, of needing to act, came over both of them. When it mutated into fear, the second voice pleaded.

“Okay, enough!” It sounded like it was choking.

Slowly, methodically, the sensations receded, like the tide. The mind was clear again.

“We need to stick with the plan.” The second voice continued, now more sure of itself. “We didn’t get to finish the experiment with Faustus, but we got what we needed.” The voice was reassuring itself more than it was speaking to the other one. “Soon, we will continue into the next phase.”

There was just silence.

Somewhere, in a dark room, a figure sank its head in its hands, and sobbed lightly.

# Questions

Erika stood before the open gates of the Grand Archive. She hadn’t been there since her days as a cadet in the Academy, but she could still remember the faint smell of leather, combined with the static from the Cognitors. Around her, streams of business owners, administrative officials, and even the odd military type trickled in and out.

The Archive itself was ancient. One of the first buildings erected in Decorat, when the settlement was established a few millenia ago. Erika remembered her Academy days. This gothic shell of spiking towers was only the front to the real value of the Archive. Below ground, millions of databanks were kept in climate-controlled vaults that ran through the inside of the hill, like a backbone.

Those vaults contained knowledge. Acquired, classified and stored over hundreds of generations.

From where she stood, Erika could see the stained-glass windows depicting various episodes of the Great Expansion, and even some scenes of the old Solar Wars.

She joined the people going in and out of the building, eager to get started.

---

“MILITIA CLEARANCE: APPROVED. THIS WAY, PLEASE” said the Archiver servo, waving towards one of the upper floors. Its tinny voice, coming out of synthetizers permantently grafted onto its face, gave away no emotion. The red hood of the Archivers covered its face.

Like all servos, its shilhouette ended abruptly just below the bellybutton. Instead of legs, its body terminated in a metallic disc that dislodged from the pillar it was resting on, as it started hovering towards the stairs.

Erika followed the robbed figure, entering the upper corridors of the Archive. Her boots barely made a sound on the carpet-covered floor. The ceilings were covered ornately etched wood, and the walls were lined with enormous paintings depicting glorious battles against alien races. The Archiver arrived at a small wooden door at the end of the hallway, etched with a big, mechanical 5:

“WE HAVE ARRIVED. COGNITOR CONSOLE ROOM 5.” He opened the door. “MAY YOU FIND ANSWERS TO ALL YOUR QUERIES.”

The Interface Room was empty, except for the four Cognitor Consoles arranged in a circle, in the middle. Erika signalled Tristan to step off her shoulder, and sat down in one of the leather armchairs. The glyphs of the console came to life when she touched the command interface:

```

Erika thought for a moment.

```

Erika remembered her training. She hadn’t used a Cognitor Console since her days in the Academy, but thousands of hours doing research had etched the commands into her muscle memory. With a few taps of the keys, she arrived at the man she was looking for. She pulled the datasheet. It had been updated ten years ago, in the last Data Entry Rites.

```
Citizen Profile:

```

The story was common enough: A Gridder gets promoted to MILITIA clearance, goes ballistic and gets one too many resets. *How does someone like that end up screaming obscenities on the street?*

What she had seen on the walls looked like way more than a faulty reset.

Erika transferred the details to her eye’s storage system, to follow up later. A couple of expert keypresses brought her back to a new search.

```
Please state your query:

Gathering results... Done (in 29ms).

```

*Damn!* It was a long shot anyway, but she didn’t have that much more to go from. However, the failed query also gave her some information. *That was fast. Too fast*. Somebody had accessed these files recently, and the results had been saved in the temporary memory. *Agent Minsk is not the only one looking into this* she thought. More people were looking for answers. People with more power, and more resources. Dangerous people.

With renewed impulse, Erika continued searching for anything that could help her father.

---

Several hours later, she didn’t have much. She had found many isolated cases of people suddenly having violent outburst dating many years back, but only a few had been properly catalogued, and none mentioned the same names that Faustus had been screaming.

Erika rubbed her eyes, tired after staring at the blinking glyphs for the better part of the day. A very bored cat seized this opportunity to climb on top of the console, demanding Erika’s attention. She smiled, and started petting him.

“You’re right, Tristan. We need a break” she said.

“You have a wise friend, Major Belcroft” said a voice frome the other side of the room.

Erika sprang up and looked in the direction the voice was coming from. A man was sitting in the Console opposite to Erika. He looked old, well in his sixties, but he must have been very quiet to slip into the room without Erika noticing. He was wearing simple black robes, with silver embroidery accenting the neck and cuffs. An Inspectorate “I” in a gold chain hung from his neck.

“Sorry to have startled you, Mamzel. Please excuse my rudeness. I’ve been admiring your furious dedication and your furry companion for quite a few moments now, and I was wondering which one would win.” The man had a wide, benevolent smile on his face. “But where are my manners. Now that I’ve interrupted your cat’s moment, I feel in need to make amends by introducing myself. Inspector Ozmund Trygon, at your service and the Solar Empire.” He made a flawless reverence. "Not in that order, of course."

*Inspector,* she thought. *So this is the one that landed the same day as me.*

“No need to apologize, Inspector. I am Major Erika of House Belcroft.”

“I know, Mamzel. Once I recognized the insignia on your coat, it wasn’t hard to figure out who you were. Not many people return from their outer rim duty before retirement.”

Erika understood exactly what the Inquisitor's smile was implying, but managed to hide the fear that pierced the back of her neck. She doubted her clearance would protect her from Inspectors. The Empire gave them absolute power, and unlimited resources. If one of them wished you gone, they had full authority to exterminate a whole system, just to make sure they got to you.

It was often said that an Inspector is the last enemy anyone ever makes, because they rarely live to make another.

“How observant. I wouldn’t expect less.” said Erika, managing a smile.

"I myself wear no distinction salve this 'I', for the only thing important about me is my eternal servitude to humanity, and the Empire.” He bowed again. Unnecessarily. “Tell me, mamzel – are you familiar with the outbreaks of millenium 7?” Erika shook her head. “The Madness, as was more commonly known, was a malady that spread across entire worlds across the Betanzed systems, killing millions. As the story goes, it didn’t just kill the man – it anihilated the soul. It turned good people into raving beasts, stranding them from proper, civilised behaviour. Death came quick, but the dying still had time to pledge themselves to darkness. Much like the damned man that attacked you, if the reports are correct. In the end, we Inspectors ended up having to... intervene.

"How?"

I'm afaraid there was only one option at that point. We had the entire system purged.” The inspector paused, looking at her intently. "A sad affair, really. But necessary."

His expression had suddenly turned somber. Erika could only manage a gulp as the silence fell between them. 

“However!” The inquisitor’s face regained his pleasing expression. “That could not possibly be the same illness – it was eradicated decades ago!” Trygon smiled, like nothing had happened.

“A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mamzel Belcroft. I have learned all that I needed from here, so I must be going now. I’m sure our paths will cross again soon, and I await that opportunity eagerly. Please give my regards to your father.” He bowed a third time, and exited the room.

As he walked out, Erika noticed that his steps were the steps of someone a lot younger, and a lot more agile. *And a lot more deadly*. She also noticed that he had left his console online.

Erika walked around the room, and stared into the Console where the Inquisitor had been. It read:

```

GOODBYE, MAMZEL BELCROFT.

REMEMBER, WE ALL SERVE THE EMPIRE AND HUMANKIND, ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.

=== Session Terminated. ===

```

*Fuck! He did it on purpose.*

Erika took a deep breath to regain her composure. *I can’t do anything about that now*, she thought, looking out of a big window.

From her vantage point at the top of the Archive’s tower, Erika saw the masses of Cognitor operators going in and out of shifts. Tides of people, moving between the Archive and the mag-trams that connected them to the lower levels.

“I guess we don’t have a choice now, Tristan” She said to the cat. “We’ll have to go talk to Lizah. Not looking forward to that.”

Tristan jumped to her shoulder, and they started making their way to their flier.

# Old Friends

Erika wasn’t looking forward to this to begin with, but standing in front of Lizah’s engraved wood door had been a painfully sharp reminder of how far her Academy friend had come. A golden plaque read “Master Archiver Lizah Warr”, surrounded by the field of stars that symbolized the Solar Empire.

Erika knocked three sharp knocks.

“Come in!” Said a raspy voice from the inside. That surprised Erika. Lizah was approximately the same age as her, but she sounded… old. She opened the door without making a sound, and the sight of her friend confirmed her suspicions. A hunched woman sat at a desk in the center of a round room, its walls lined with bookshelves bursting with old tomes.

“Long time no see” Said Erika, stepping into the carpeted floor. Lizah lifted her head from the console encased in her table, surprised.

“Erika? Is that you?” She seemed genuinely surprised. She got up, and Erika took a good look at her old friend. She had always been shorter, but now she wasn't much taller than a child. She was wearing the pristine robes of the Master Archiver, red velvet lined with gold in the cuffs of the wide sleeves. Her face surprised Erika more than anything. It was gaunt, dry, full of wrinkles. If someone didn’t know better, they’d never have guessed which one of the two had spent the last decades in a battlefield.

Despite that, Lizah’s movement was brisk and agile as she hugged her. Belcroft returned the hug, awkwardly.

“Welcome, welcome! I never thought I’d see you again! Let me take a look at you” Lizah stepped back a few paces, looking at her. She fixated on a small, almost imperceptible loose thread on one of Erika’s buttons. She looked at it for a few seconds, emitted a disapproving “Tsk.”, and smiled.

Erika rolled her eyes. That was more like the Lizah she knew. They were good friends, but there was a reason she wasn’t looking forward to this.

“And who is this here?” Lizah said, turning to Tristan. The cat had dislodged from his harness, and was prancing around the room, sniffing around the piles of neatly stacked paperwork and rows of identical tomes.

“That’s Tristan. I found him in a mission in Belisarus 19, and he’s stuck to me ever since.”

Lizah offered a hand for Tristan to smell, and then started petting him. The cat purred loudly, bumping his head against the Master Archiver's gentle palm.

“He’s adorable. You have to tell me all about him later. But this is not a pleasure visit is it. You were never the type to waste time on things like, you know, being *nice* to people. Plus you've always liked trudging in mud in some forsaken world out there too much.” Erika had to admit, she was right. Lizah had always been brilliant, and she had always known her well. “What can I help you with?”

“You know me too well, Lizah. I’m actually here on a case. The Corp wants to keep this secret from the Empire, so I’d appreciate your discretion, given your current position.”

“Of course.”

“There have been more disappearances than usual in the last few months. Corporate is worried that it will affect the profits, and —“

“Of course they are!” Lizah erupted “Stars forbid if they miss one of their sales targets!”

Erika was expecting this sort of comment from Lizah, she didn't even pause.

“Right, I know you’d rather see the Corp go to hell, but one of the dissappeared people happens to be my father. The only lead I have is a name, Kyriel. It was plastered all over someone’s hab walls, and I think he has something to do with the disappearances. I tried to search the Archive, but I don’t have enough clearance.”

“I see…” Lizah stopped to think for a moment. She muttered under her breath for a while, as if talking to herself. Eventually, she turned to Erika, a serious expression on her face “Okay. I will help you. For the record, I don’t like using my status like this, much less to help the Coporation.” She turned to walk to the console on her desk. “But real people are suffering, and, well, I trust you to do the right thing.”

“Thank you, Lizah” Despite her frustrations, Erika *was* truly grateful for that. She had been scared that her working for Sagitar would have deterred Lizah.

“Let’s see…” Lizah said, pushing a few of the glyphs on her screen. Almost instantly, her screen beeped with a response. She exclaimed “Ah, right. Here it is. Kyriel. You’ve found an interesting one, although I’m not sure it will help you. According to our records, Kyriel is the name of a mythological creature. Apparently, the race that used to live here, in this system, venerated it amongst other deities. This is all information from the Great Expansion, so it’s a bit fragmented.” She continued reading "Oh, yes... I see..." Erika appreciated how much Lizah enjoyed diving into it. She wasn’t Master Archiver by accident, she had always loved getting lost into any sort of data “Yes… here is a bit more. Kyriel, or Khiri’el, was venerated as the god of control, order and justice.”

Lizah lifted her eyes, looking at Erika.

“I’m afraid that’s all it says. I’m not sure that helps. The myth of Kyriel probably died with the aliens when humans colonized Decorat.”

Erika pondered that for a second. Lizah was right, that wasn’t much more to go with “But how does that end up plastered all over someone’s house?”

“I don’t know. Whose house was it?”

“A nobody, just a Cognitor Operator."

"A _nobody_?" There was reproach in Lizah's eyes, but Erika didn't have time for that.

"He had had been promoted to full clearance sectors a few months back.”

“Ah! That must be it then. He must have gotten PodDisease during a query. Some Balancer must have pointed him to the wrong databank. Happens more than any of us would like, but it's nothing to worry about.”

“Right… But he got resetted very recently. How come the disease data wasn’t erased from his memory? And what data could be so bad to drive him that mad? That thing you've just read about alies not nearly enough to cause severe PodDisease.”

“Sometimes resets do strange things to people, Erika." She sighed. "You’ve been away for a long time, but I’ve seen many good people suffer horribly after a reset.”

“I guess you’re right” There was something not quite fitting this situation, but Erika figured she couldn’t get anything else from her friend. Lizah seemed to believe it was noting out of the ordinary “Thank you, Lizah. This was very helpful.”

“I doubt it, but you’re welcome anyway. Just… do the right thing, okay? Help those people.”

“I’m doing this for my father, Lizah, and for my family. Not for any other reason.”

“I guess that’ll have to do. Just don’t do it for Sagitar.”

“I’ve always wondered, what’s your problem with the Corp? You come from the hill, just like me, and Sagitar has treated us well. Both your family and mine work for them, and they have been generous.”

Lizah walked to the window, and invited Erika to go with her. From her office at the top of one of the Archive’s tallest towers, Lizah had a unique view encompassing the Spires above and the Grid below.

“Look around you, Erika. Look what the Corp is doing to this world. They employ people to work in the Archive as Operators or support staff, paying them a misery and pocketing the rest of the money the Empire gives them. They have bought the starports, and now they get to take a cut of the food and medicine as well.” She waved her arm, encompassing the Grid. “Drugs that these people need to live, because they’re sick with the pollution that the Corporation generates. All in the name of profit. That isn’t right.”

“Those people down there,” Erika responded “they are keeping themselves there. I’ve seen all their bars, Lizah, and the PleaseCogs. They could work harder, save that money, and bring themselves up. But they don't. Instead, they waste it all in drinks and excess.”

“Easy for us to say that, Erika *Belcroft*”

A heavy silence fell in the room, as Erika stared at her friend's hardened face.

“I’ve worked to get where I am." Erika broke the silence first "You know how hard we’ve studied at the Academy, you know the decades I’ve spent fighting and improving myself. I’ve earned every promotion.”

Lizah didn’t take her eyes off the landscape.

“I don’t doubt that, old friend. I’ve worked too, and that has taken me far.” Lizah sighed. She looked tired. Not only of that particular conversation, but rather of the world as a whole. “Someday, you’ll see. Everyone will see. Or we’re all doomed.”

“Maybe I will, Lizah, but now I see a world that is how it is, and we can’t do anything about it except find my father.”

Lizah looked out of the window, deep in thought. After a few seconds, like she just remembered Erika was there, she turned to her with a smile.

“Yeah, you’re right! Go an find those people, and help them. Please. And let me know if I can help you with anything else.”

“You’ve already done enough, Lizah. Thank you”.

---

Going back to the mansion, sitting in the leather seats of her gravcar, Erika pondered the visit to her friend’s office. Something didn’t fit, but she couldn’t quite put her finger on it. It was common enough for Operators to need a reset after a month or two at higher clearances, but they usually didn’t remember much after them.

Plus, how did he end up in the wrong databank anyway? It was very rare for a Balancer to make that mistake. Something didn’t add up.

And then there’s the really strange thing — how little time it had taken Lizah’s query to execute. That information had been accessed recently, maybe even in the last weeks, so it was present in the short-term recent query storage. The question was — who else had this level of clearance?

A shiver ran down Erika’s spine at the thought. Whoever it was, they were powerful. And they outranked her.

---

Rien leapt from his chair. Somebody had banged on the door of their hab, and was doing it again. He hadn’t been deep in sleep to begin with — he couldn’t remember the last time he had — but the loud clang of metal on the aluminum door had startled him nonetheless.

Luckily, his sister was sound asleep after taking the tranquilizer a few hours earlier.

It was night, and it was cold. He grabbed his jacket on the way to the door. He was still trying to pull his right arm into the sleeve when he opened the door and a powerful hand grabbed him by the neck of his overalls, pushing him against the cold metal of the doorframe.

“Good night, boy” Said a familiar voice.

Rien’s mind cleared a bit after the initial shock, and he saw the old woman from *The Interchange* stepping through the threshold of his hab, using a steel cane for support. He also saw the massive plated fist that was pegging him to the wall, and the vaguely human-shaped tower of muscles that was attached to it. He felt a warm liquid trickle down the back of his neck. He was bleeding somewhere.

“Time’s up. Hope you have your credits ready.” Said the woman, sitting in the chair he had been sleeping in. She looked around his hab, and tutted with disapproval. “Although I have a strong feeling that you don’t have them. Am I wrong?”

That was it. It had finally happened. His debts had finally caught up with him.

“N-no, I don’t. My sister and I need to eat. But I-I’ll have them by next week, I promise!”

“Not good enough” she said, not even looking at him. “Igor, do your thing”

Rien felt a sharp tug and a fist in his belly. His body doubled over, and emptied his stomach’s contents empty on a pile of dirty clothes. Before he had time to recover, still dizzy with pain, and Igor picked him up, taking him outside. The goon lifted him up and carried him to the edge of the passageway, where the hab-tower gave way to a black abyss. Rien felt a gust of warm air coming from the void below as he hovered over the edge of the Grid.

It was a long drop. The floor level of the Grid wasn’t visible with clear daylight, much less at night.

*This is it*, he thought as Igor lifted him up over the safety railway. The man's bulging muscles were the only thing keeping him from dropping hundreds of levels now.

*I’m really sorry Cel, I did my best*.

Igor released one hand, and Rien's body fell a few inches more. He was about to fall. He closed his eyes… wishing he died quickly.

*Goodbye.*

... But he didn’t fall.

“Unless,” came the woman’s voice from inside the hab. Igor stopped, and tossed Rien inside. The boy lay there, in shock. “Unless you’re willing to work for it, boy.”

Rien tried to get up, but could only manage to kneel. His legs felt weak.

“Some rich lady has been bothering the boss for a while. She’s been in one of our clubs, asking questions.” The woman turned to Rien “The boss wants her gone.”

Rien felt a shiver down his spine. “M-me? K-kill her?” He hadn’t hurt anyone before, much less... that. His sister had insisted in him keeping out of the gangs, even when their parents passed and they were left with… well, nothing.

The woman bursted in a fit of laughter that made Rien’s bones chill.

“You? You? That’s rich, boy. Look at yourself! You couldn’t do it if you wanted! You should have seen the number she did on the Viglio brothers. Nah, the boss is sending a full team for her. But that doesn’t mean we can’t all do our part, eh? We’ve heard you’ve got a knack with tools and locks. That right?”

Rien could only manage to nod weakly. He was starting to think clearly again.

“Good. Boss wants someone to go in before the team and inspect the place. Get in, and use one of the mapper drones to scout. Then the team sweeps in and does the deed. Sounds good?”

Rien got the courage to get up, and looked at Igor’s mass of stimmed muscles, clogging the door.

“Doesn’t look like I have much of a choice” He said.

He immediately realized his mistake.

Igor’s backhand caught him in the nape of the neck and threw him to the pile of dirty clothes. Rien’s stomach turned with the smell.

“You insolent snot, you should be grateful that I’m here talking. If I wasn’t, Igor would have come alone, and he’s a lot harder to reason with.”

“All right” Rien said, between breaths “I’ll do it.”

“Excellent. Come to *The Interchange* next week at dawn. And don’t bother bringing the attitude.” She got up, and poked Cel with her cane. “So *this* is what you wanted the drugs for, huh. Noble, I guess.”

Rien clenched his fist as the woman and Igor walked out of the hab. He sat against the wall, trying to return his heart to a normal rythm.

# Duty

*The trees are spooking me out,* Rien thought, as he made his way through the streets of the upper city.

Yes, the clean air was surprising, and the big houses stood menacing at either side of the wide, wide road. But the trees were the worst part. Rien had only read about them in children’s books, but seeing them there, standing taller than the houses, the street lights turning their branches into menacing shadows, he felt as if they were going to grab him at any time.

He knew they weren’t real, he knew they were synthetic. But still, he couldn’t shake the feeling.

A gust of cold wind ruffled his hair, and he snugged up in his jacket. Compared with the warm, sticky bursts of exhaust that formed the “wind” down in the Grid, this night breeze was welcome. In the inner pocket of his coat, he felt the weight of the small pirated reconaissance drone they'd given him. Their instructions were clear: Sneak in, scan each room, and get out of the way. The adults would come in a few minutes after him, and finish the job.

Rien wasn’t looking forward to this.

The streets were empty, salve for very expensive-looking gravcars parked on helipads, neatly marked in white lines. Rien could see lights dancing from the windows of the big mansions, like giant orange eyes, staring at each other. He wondered why someone needed a house *that* big.

He finally arrived at the one he was looking for. A big mansion like the others, with a “B” painted on the helipad out front as the only indication of address.

*Lucky*. This one didn’t have light on it, it looked deserted. Constanza’s info had been good, and whoever they wanted dead was out. Just to be sure, though, Rien stopped and took a hard turn before arriving. He hid in the bush gardens of one of the neighbouring houses, taking cover from any suspecting looks.

He waited and looked at the house.

When we was sure he was hidden from sight, he snook to the back of the house. He checked once more, and dashed to the backdoor. It was closed for most, but not for him. He examined the pommel. _A simple Richter model-3 passcode lock._ Easy. Using his scrambler, he dislodged the number entry pad. The scrambler was a blunt tool, it completely destroyed the pad. Not elegant, but very effective.

A simple bridge and pull later, the door clicked open.

“Going in”, whispered Rien to the commlink in his ear, and entered the mansion.

He switched his headlight on. The first room was impressive, a wide open area surrounded by marble counters with a hob and a sink, with marble cabinets on top. Probably a kitchen, and by far the cleanest room Rien had ever been in. He started up the drone, and it flew to the center of the massive area. A thin strip of blue light burst out of the small machine, and it started moving mathodically through the space.

*Damn Constanza,* thought Rien. *He doesn’t even buy the newer models. This is going to take forever.*

After a few minutes, the drone was still scanning the kitchen. Rien was feeling confident that the house was empty, so we was looking in the cabinets for something to eat. He didn’t find anything that he considered food. The only thing he found were vacuum-sealed bags of different shimmering colours, stamped with labels from places he'd never heard of. He realized these were all caffeine grains, and wondered what kind of person has an entire room dedicated to it. Where did these people keep the food?

After a few more minutes, he decided he was very bored, and went on to explore other parts of the house. As long as he left all the doors open, the drone would scan by itself.

It didn’t take him long to realise that the first room was not representative of the house. The rest of the rooms were *even* *more* impressive. Not only were they clean, but they were all… huge.

Paintings of old people larger than Rien covered the walls. The polished floors were a matte black marble, and the doors and the main staircase were wood. Real wood!

Curiously enough, the doors on the mansion weren’t locked. Most of them *had* locks, but the owners had *decided* not to use them. Whoever lived here, must be very powerful or very stupid.

Rien felt very small as he climbed up the main stairwell.

He had already visited a dozen rooms — all with the same rich decoration — when he found the first locked door, at the left of the staircase.

*Finally, something interesting.*

This lock wasn’t like the simple lock of the backdoor. This one was biometric, with fingerprint and heart rate scanners. It was a tough one, but Rien figured that it would have important stuff in it — nobody expected that lock to be cracked. And nobody could… Except Lucitav. And Rien had learned a lot from Lucitav.

The fingerprint was easy. Whoever unlocked it had likely left their prints on the door handle as well. Rien pulled out the extraction kit that Luci had given him, and made copies from all the prints he could find in the handle.

The heart rate was a bit tougher. It knew who the owner’s resting heart rate was, and it only opened if the door handle measured the right rythm and intensity. Luci had taught Rien about these locks some time ago, saying “You can’t hack these, kid, but you can fool them. Most burglars are on alert when they’re working, but not us. To crack these, we need to learn to be calm, to control our emotions. That way, we can control our hearts.”

Rien had never expected to be in this situation, so he hadn't bothered practicing this much. And now it was going to bite him in the ass. He hoped it was enough. He grabbed the handle, closed his eyes, and focused on the rythm in his chest.

It was beating surprisingly fast. He tried to relax, taking deep breaths. Step by step, the rythmic thump of his heart slowed down. He could almost feel the adrenaline being flushed out of his system.

A minute passed.

Two minutes.

Ten.

Rien was sure he was relaxed, but the lock wouldn’t budge. He opened his eyes. He was stuck. That was it, he was out of ideas. Why didn’t it open?

A loud crash made him jump briefly.

It was the drone, hitting something. The adrenaline rushed back in, undoing all the work of the past few minutes. *Damn cheap Constanza, after all this work to relax*. Thought Rien, leaning towards the door. He would have to start again, because of that damn cheap drone.

The lock beeped with a green light, and Rien almost fell into the room. It took him a second to realize. When he did, he almost laughed out loud.

*It’s not the resting heart rate! Whoever locked this was very angry when they did it.* Rien couldn’t believe his luck. Maybe that cheap piece of scrap drone had some use after all.

This room was slightly different than the others. It has the usual paintings and rugs and desks, but it also had a coat, a lasgun and a pair of boots hanging from a hook. The other rooms looked like they had always been empty, but somebody was living in this one. Plus, that coat looked familiar somehow…

A cold shiver ran down Rien’s spine as he remembered. That “B” at the front helipad looked a lot more familiar embroidered in a military coat. This wasn’t any rich person’s house. This was *her* house! The one from the starport, the one that — *gulp* — had knocked out a man just because she was in a hurry, and had cut down two others without blinking.

A wave of panic took over Rien. He had assumed that Constanza’s people would have no problem dispatching some big fish, but he wasn’t so sure now.

What if the lady won? What they couldn’t kill her? Even worse... Rien was sure a woman like that had taken precautions. What if she figured out he had been there?

Rien looked around in a frenzy, looking for something, *anuything* that could get him out of this one.

*Okay, think. How do we get out of this? Think, Rien, think. What do we do? She’s going to find out, and if Constanza’s can’t kill her, she’s going to kill me. Wait. Unless…*

It was a long shot, but Rien was too terrified of the woman to think clearly. He grabbed the coat and the gun, and darted outside.

---

Erika rubbed her eyes, as the flier landed in a big white “B” that denoted House Belcroft’s helipad. She had a lot to think about, but she needed to rest. She was looking forward to a cup of caffeine, and maybe a game of dames with Olin. Tristan was curled on the passenger seat, napping.

When the flier’s doors opened, the cat woke up and stretched himself, looking at her.

“We’re home dear. Not that you had trouble sleeping.”

The cat’s ears perked up, and he turned to face one of the bushes.

“What is it, dear? Show me.” Erika’s augment connected to Tristan’s sight. At night, the the cat's eyes were much better than her own. She saw what he was seeing, and she couldn’t believe her eyes. Again! That boy again! And he had her gun. How?

Erika blinked to disconnect from Tristan, and she got out of the car. She walked casually towards the house. When she was close enough, she leapt into the bush and grabbed the boy by the collar, pulling him out.

“You keep getting in my way, boy.” She snarled. That grid rat was visibly frightened. *Good.* “You have ten seconds to explain yourself, before…” She let her words hang.

“It’s not what it looks like! I mean no harm! Well, I did, but that was before knowing it was you! What I mean is... well... I-I’m here to save your life.”

He didn’t sound very confident, and Erika decided that he had probably rehearsed those words right before. Still, maybe he was worth listening to. She released him, and tore her lasgun from his hands.

“Go on. You’re not out of the woods yet.”

“B-but first, you’ll have to pay me.” He managed to sound even less confident this time.

“And why would I do that? I can just hurt you if you don’t talk. I can hurt you _bad_.”

Rien looked at her “Please…” behind the fear, his eyes betrayed a deep desperation. Erika remembered her talk with Lizah just before. Even hours after leaving her, Lizah was being annoying.

“Oh, all right. We’ll see what you have to say. If you’re indeed saving my life, I’ll pay you, okay?”

“D-deal.” The boy nodded, relieved. He reached to his ear, and took a commlink bead out of it, offering it to Erika. “Here, listen.”

Erika pulled it close, and she heard a low, roughened voice “… Dorcas, Borscht, cover the entrance. Going in.”

“What is this?” She asked.

“Those people are inside your house right now, waiting to kill you. I’m offering you the earpiece, to let you know where they are.”

“And how do you know about it?”

“They told me to stay here on watch, and then I recognized the mark on your heliport, and I decided I had better odds with you.”

Erika had to admit, she was impressed with the kid. He’d had the guts to turn on his people. Furthermore, he’d had the guts to lie to her about what he was doing there. He had the gun, so he must have been inside the house. Erika let it slip.

“Alright, boy. I have to admit, this is good information. Now stay in the car, I have work to do.” Erika fastened the holster of the lasgun to her belt, and unsheathed her power estoc. Then she turned to Rien “If I get through the night, you’ll get paid” She wanted to ensure that he wasn’t going to shoot her in the back. "And don't touch anything!" She added, already walking toward the house.

Rien nodded weakly, and went to the car.

Erika placed the bead in her ear, and called Olin using her augment.

“Yes, mamzel?” The butler’s voice was calm and collected.

“Olin, there’s people in the house.”

“I know.”

“Were you going to tell me about it?”

“I was, mamzel, but the boy seemed very eager to do so himself. He was sneaking around the house earlier.”

“And you let him?”

“He seemed harmless, mamzel, unlike our most recent arrivals” Erika heard zippers close, and metal pieces click on the other side of the intercom.

“You and I are going to have a chat later. Where are you right now?”

“I’m in the cellar, getting ready to meet our guests. I don’t think they know I’m here.” Erika smiled. Those thugs didn’t know what they were in for.

“Alright, Olin, I’m going in. Let’s show them why they shouldn’t have come into our house.”

“Let’s mamzel.” She heard a loud click, probably of a magazine being slot into place. “I’ll meet you in the library.”

With the location of the thugs in her ear and Tristan at her side, Erika powered to the front door.

---

*“Comms check, go”* Borscth heard Alda through his link. He had always admired the efficiency of their team leader.

“Miles, rooftop, in position” The voice of the sharpshooter was choppy over the vox link. Probably the distance.

“Vance, stairs, standing by”

“Dorcas, stairs, standing by this idiot”

“Hey, watch it” Vance said.

“You two, focus.” Alda barked through the link. “the boy got us the upper hand, but that rich ninker is still military. She's dangerous.”

“Sorry”

“Sorry”

From his perch inside the woman’s room, Borscht chuckled. Those two never learned. They would have killed each other long ago if they weren’t so damn good as a pair.

“Borscth? Borscht, come in”

Borscht snapped back to it “Yes, sorry. Main dormitory, check”

He had done it again.

*Focus, Borscht. Focus.*

“Alda, kitchen, check. Stand by, and keep your eyes open.”

The link cut with a crackle, and everything became still.

After a few minutes of silence, Borscht got bored and started pacing around the room. What was it Constanza had said about this lady? She was military, from the Expansion Corps. He looked at the wall. A diploma from the Academy, officer’s track, graduated with honors. Borscht reckoned he would have liked to go to the Academy. He could have made it to major, or even admiral. Instead, he had ended up as an ex-file trooper with a bad knee.

“Eh.” He said to himself, shrugging “we get what we get.”

“Shut up, Borscht” Alda’s voice bursted from the link.

"I got eyes on the target." Miles' voice was choppy through the commlink "Front door."

“Great she doesn’t know” Alda said “Take her down, Miles. We might make it to dinner after all”

“Roger that, cap.” Miles was only excited when he got someone on his sights. “Within range in 3… 2… 1…”

He never got to zero. A whir, a screech, and a wet, gurgling sound sprouted from the link, and Miles’ connection cut off.

“Miles! Miles, respond. Did you take the shot?” Alba said “Oh, fuck. They know! Be on guard!” Though the link they heard grunting and sharp thuds. She didn’t say anything else.

After a few seconds, there was silence. Borscht felt adrenaline surging through his system.

“Should we go check it out?” Vance asked.

“No, stand guard and cover your angles” He said. “If you get eyes on her, don’t hesistate. Take the shot”

“Roger”

A few more seconds passed, and nothing happened. Borscth adjusted his grip on the riot shotgun. His hand was starting to sweat.

Shots fired down the hall.

“Got her!” Exclaimed Dorcas “I think I nicked her arm. She’s taken cover, but we got her. She’ll have to come out eventually.”

Borscht heard a few more shots. Not only his colleague’s solid rounds, but also the high pitch of laser fire.

“She’s returning fire. This might take a while” Said Vance. “Dorcas, I’ll give you cover fire, you go and finish her.”

“Roger”

More shots, at intermittent intervals. Suppression fire.

“I’m close” Dorcas said.

“Great, just get it over with. I’m running out.”

And then the fire stopped. Borscht heard a blunt thud through the link.

“Oh, fuck!” Said Dorcas.

“What, what is it? Dorcas, is she done? Vance? Confirm status”

“There’s two of them! Some old guy with a gun slapped Vance. Fuck, I’m pinned. Borscht, get your ass here and help”

Borscht was already moving before she said that. He charged through the door, shotgun in hand. He would surprise the old guy from behind, and then they would be two on one. It was an easy shot…

He wasn’t there. Borscht got to the top of the staircase, and saw Vance’s corpse. And then his arm got blasted to pieces. He could only turn and see the old man with an old-model blast gun, coming at him from behind.

“Borcht? What was that?” Dorcas’ voice sounded frenzied.

“H-how?” Was the only thing Borscht managed to say to the old man. “How did you know?”

The old man didn’t say anything. He just pointed the gun at Borscth, and squeezed the trigger.

# Discovery

At some point, Rien got tired of waiting in the car. The woman had taken the keys, so the climate unit was turned off and the night chill had found its way through the seams into his bones.

Plus, he hadn’t heard a sound in a while after those shots.

He got out of the car, and walked towards the now quiet mansion. We was surprised at how fast everything had happened, and how quickly the world was, apparently, back to normal. Only one light on the ground floor betrayed the fact that the house wasn’t empty.

When he knocked on the door, it wasn’t the woman that answered. It was an old man. He was hunched, looked well in his eighties, with a shaved head and a thick moustache. Most strangely, he was wearing a tactical suit, and Rien was willing to bet it was military grade. He also had a menacing shotgun slinged on his back from a strip across his chest.

“Yes? Are you lost, young man?” He said, smiling to Rien.

Rien didn’t know what to make of him. He didn’t know if the man was with the rich lady. *However,* Rien thought, *look at his gear. He sure isn’t with Constanza, that kit looks expensive.* Rien decided to take the gamble.

“Miss B told me that she would pay me if she survived” He really didn’t know what “B” stood for, but it was a reasonable guess.

“Oh, did she now?” The man looked genuinely surprised, even amused. He looked inside, smiling. “Well then, boy. Better get you inside.” He started walking towards the light inside. “Come along!”

Rien followed him inside. In the light, he could see the man’s weapon bobbing as he walked. It had some spots around the butt. They looked… wet.

“Mind your step, please” The old man said without looking back.

Rien looked down, and immediately regretted it. Three corpses lay on the floor, face down. A cleaning drone was scrubbing the remains of blood and tissue that were everywhere. They were all Constanza’s team, or what was left of them. One of them was even missing an arm.

Rien’s stomach turned, and he threw up violently in the lobby floor.

The old man turned, an air of compassion in his eyes.

“I suppose I should have warned you, my apologies. Don’t worry about the floor, the servos will take care of it.” He produced a handkerchief from his breastpoket, and he handed it to Rien “You knew these people?”

Still doubled over and panting, Rien took the handkerchief and wiped his mouth. He shook his head. He barely remembered their names. He realized how little that fact bothered him.

“Good. I suspected as much. You don’t seem the type to get involved with gangsters.” He signalled to the wide crystal door that gave way to the lit room. “If you’re ready, I’m sure you’d like to talk to mamzel”.

Rien could only utter a weak “Thank you” as he passed the threshold. And he was, truly grateful. Regardless of how scary he was, so far the old man had treated him better than anyone had in a long time.

Rien had already been inside the library when he was scanning the mansion, but he was surprised at how much it changed with the lights on. There even was a holofire that projected dancing warm shadows to the walls covered in synthwood. Miss B was standing in the center of the room, her back turned to Rien, eyes fixed on the holofire. A hovering servo whirred, as it administered a biosalve to a nasty wound in her right arm.

“What is it, Olin?” She said without turning.

“I-it’s not Olin, miss. It’s me. You promised to pay me if you survived.”

“Oh, it’s you.” She said indifferently. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you. Those thugs were very well positioned, you know. I was wondering how they would know where to hide." Rien's world froze for a moment "And then I found this.” She turned, and Rien could see that she was holding on her left hand. That piece of crap drone. *Damn. I left it in the house. “*You broke into my house, didn’t you? And you mapped it out for them”

Rien felt her penetrating gaze fixed on his face. He should be scared. He should run, and maybe whe'd make it to the widnow. That was the sensible thing to do. Instead sudden burst of courage flooded him. There wasn’t a point in lying anymore.

“Yes, I did. I had no choice, you know? I don’t have the luxury of all… this. We needed the money” He said, waving at all the objects around the room “Plus, I came back, didn’t I? If it weren’t me, some other poor boy would have done it. But I came back! I gave you my earpiece, and now you’re alive. I saved your life, and you promised to pay, so pay up!”

Rien realized what he had just said, and to whom. He'd had gone too far. A dead silence fell in the room, and Erika looked at him inquisitively, one eyebrow raised. Rien heard a chuckle from behind him.

“The boy has a nerve, mamzel!” Rien turned to see the old man standing there, smiling warmly. He winked at Rien, which comforted him somewhat. Like a hot beverage in a rainy day. “He is right, though. His aid was invaluable in getting us out unscathed.”

“This is unscathed, Olin?” Erika pointed to the gunshot wound on her arm.

“A minor brush. We both know you’ve endured much worse”.

“Still, why should we pay him? He’s one of *them!* He came with them, he… dresses like them! He is a criminal, and we should turn him over to the Enforcers.” At the mention of the Enforcers, Rien froze.

The old man adopted a grave expression.

“I thought I had taught you better than this, mamzel. You know this young man is not a criminal by choice. Look at him in the eye and tell me you think he’s like those five out there.”

Erika looked at Rien.

Rien tried to hold her gaze with all he had. For some reason, he knew that his future depended on her decision.

Finally, the woman sighed.

“You’re right, Olin.”

Olin’s expression relaxed. “As per usual, mamzel” Daggers flew from the woman's eyes, but Olin just widened his smile.

“No need to rub it in”.

“I find that lessons tend to stick better when I do, mamzel.” Rien felt an overwhelming sense of respect for the man.

“Fine. Then *you’ll* be the one to guard him while I go for the money.” The woman stormed out. When she was about to exit, she turned to Rien. “I still don’t trust you, boy. I’m locking you in.”

“I don’t think that’s necess —“

“It wasn’t a question, Olin”

She slammed the door, and Rien heard the combination lock click closed behind him. The man named Olin sighed. “She always had a temper.”

He removed the gun and the gloves, placing them on a large meatal tray. Very calmly and methodically, he took off the tactical vest to reveal an immaculate suit. He folded everything carefully, and then sat down in one of two big armchairs by the holofire. He turned to Rien.

“Take a seat, boy. She won’t come down for a minute, and you must be exhausted.”

Hesitantly, Rien sat on the other armchair. It was the most comfortable place he had ever sat on, the synthetic velvet caressing his skin. He suddenly realized how exhausted he truly was. Not just that night, but the last few months. The holofire emitted a faint warmth, and Rien let himself be enveloped by it.

After a few moments of comfortable silence, Olin talked.

“It takes guts to do what you did, young man. She doesn’t show it, but I think you impressed mamzel Belcroft.”

Rien was shocked to hear the compliment. It was an unexpected change of pace from life in the Grid.

“Thank you, sir.” Was all he could manage.

“Call me Olin. Oh, I just realized, we haven’t been introduced properly. I apologize again. I’m Olin, butler of house Belcroft. That lady you just talked to is Mamzel Erika Belcroft, the only daughter of the house.”

“I’m Rien, sir. Rien Vessir, from the Grids” Rien was impressed by the poise and trust of that man. He wasn’t in the slightest worried about Rien. Of course, given the state of the corpses on the hallway, Rien could imagine that he didn’t have reason to be.

“Nice to make your aquaintance, Rien. I don’t know what’s taking mamzel this long. Would you like something to drink while we wait? Some caffeine maybe?”

Rien nodded.

“Fantastic” He waved his hand over one of the armrests, and a terminal projected on top. Olin pressed some glyphs. “A servo will be here shortly. I could use some myself. I haven’t done this in years” He added, looking at the gun and tactical gear.

Rien decided to press his luck a little more

“If you don’t mind, sir —”

“Olin”

“Right. If you don’t mind, sir Olin,” The man chuckled “do all butlers do what you do?”

“Ha! No, actually. In fact, I don’t imagine many could tell one end of a gun from another.” He started at the holofire, reminiscing “I guess I’m no usual butler. I was once from the Grid, you see. Much like yourself.”

Rien was surprised. “I’ve never heard of anyone that gets out.”

The red and orange light of the holofire danced on the butler’s face.

“You’re impatient! Obviously, _I_ did get out. I’m somewhat of a particular case. I was in the Expansion Corps for a while, fighting in the Empire’s wars. I got hurt bad, and I was deemed unfit for service. When I came back, there wasn’t much for me to do. I could have easily ended up like one of those poor devils out there in the hall, if it weren’t for mamzel Erika’s father, Jordan. He saw something in me, and took me in as a butler. He even paid for decent augmetics for my arm” He extended his left arm, and Rien heard the mechanical hiss of pistons. “I’ve been with the Belcrofts ever since.”

Rien was fascinated by the old man. Part of him still couldn’t believe he had been a Gridder, seeing all his upper class words. Still, there was something that didn’t fit.

“If you were a gridder, sir, how come you’re not afraid of miss Belcroft?”

Olin erupted in a dry, joyful laughter.

“Because I practically raised her, that’s why! Her parents loved her dearly, but they were constantly working. A fortune like this doesn’t build itself, you know?” Rien had no idea how a fortune like that was built. Olin could have told him that it came from an alien world, and he would have believed it. “Hard to be scared of someone if you’ve changed their diapers. Of course, I wouldn’t bring that up if I were you. Mamzel has a famously bad temper.” Rien wasn’t planning to. Unlike Olin, Erika Belcroft still scared him almost as much as Constanza.

At that moment, Rien smelled something warm and conforting. A trap-door above the holofire opened, and two steaming cups appeared. Olin handed one to Rien, and sat down with the other.

Rien took a sip. It wasn’t like the caffeine he had tried before. Instead of the usual aggressive taste of burnt charcoal, this one tasted much softer. Rien could taste the strong brew, but also some hints of something lighter, almost refreshing. Compared to the blunt flavours he was used to, this was almost… interesting. It must have shown in his face, because Olin smiled and said

“Good, huh? It’s one of our little pleasures, imported from the mountain planets of the Bils system. Now it’s your turn, Rien Vessir. You seem like a good young man, how does someone like you end up in a mess like this?”

Comforted by the warmth of the caffeine and the softness of the velvet chair, Rien opened up and told Olin everything about his sister. He told him about the nightmares, the sedative, and how he had been forced to take credit with Constanza. He realized he hadn’t told anyone else the full story before, but it felt good to say it out loud.

When he finished, Olin’s was looking at him with compassion.

“I see… You’re strong, Rien. Your sister is lucky to have you.”

Rien didn’t respond. He couldn't. A knot had formed in his throat, and he was fighting back tears.

Olin sat back, thinking. After a while, he said

“It’s decided then. You will help mamzel Belcroft find her father. She doesn’t want to admit it, but she’ll need help for what’s to come. You’ve been able to break into this house, so you obviously have some talent. And you did the right thing alerting her, so you have a good heart. I have a feeling you’ll do great things, young man.”

“Thank you, sir, but no. I have to take care of my sister. Maybe Constanza doesn’t know that I’ve duped him, and I can get some other work. I can’t afford this, I’ll take the money and leave.”

“You have heart, young man, but you’re still too hasty. You’re thinking of buying medicine for your sister, which is commendable. But she’s not getting better, is she? What you're doing, it's a bandage, not a cure.”

Rien didn’t say anything.

“If memory serves, you know what happened to that man in the starport. What if your sister gets to that point? Will you keep her asleep forever?”

Tears filled Rien’s eyes, and he looked at Olin with impotence.

“I don’t say this to make you feel bad, boy. On the contrary, I think there’s still hope for her.” Rien wiped his tears. “You see, mamzel Erika’s father had a similar condition as you’ve described. Master Belcroft started frequenting the PleaseCog bars. Since then, he also started having nightmares, and they also got worse every day. I kept it secret from the authorities for fear that they would take him away. And now, he’s dissappeared. I think finding master Jordan is the key to helping your sister.”

Rien realized something

“You said that the nightmares began when he started going to PleaseCog bars?” he asked, wide-eyed. How could he have missed it?

“Yes, about the same time. Why?”

“The same happened to my sister! When our father died, she and her friends started a burglar crew, you know, robbing rich people, and —” He stopped suddenly, realizing what he had just admitted to.

Olin smiled a benevolent smile “I’m not going to hand her over, Rien, don’t worry. Please continue.”

Rien blushed, and continued

“One of the jobs went wrong, and they lost one of their friends. The crew broke up, my sister was very sad. She started going to the PleaseCogs a lot, to forget. Short after, the nightmares started.”

“Very interesting, indeed. You wouldn’t happen to know what bars she used to frequent, right?”

“I heard her mention some. Let’s see… there was the *TruJoi*, the *Digilove*, and that other one… *Dreamer’s!*”

“Master Belcroft used to frequent some of those as well, and *The Raven*. I wonder…”

“Wait a minute!” Rien was getting excited, forgetting everything that had happened that night. “How could I miss this! Those are all controlled by Constanza’s gang! When was the last time Mr. Belcroft was seen?”

“Very astute, boy! He was heading for the *TruJoi* when he disappeared. I think Constanza has something to say about it.”

“We have to tell Erika! We can save my sister!” Rien was so excited that he jumped from the armchair. Before Olin could stop him, he was dashing towards the door.

“Wait, boy!”

Rien didn’t hear him. Without thinking twice, he plucked the kit from his pocket and disarmed the simple lock. He opened the door, and ran upstairs to Erika’s room. Olin rushed to follow him.

---

Erika was almost done changing into clean clothes when the door slammed open and Rien almost fell through it.

“How did you…?” She started to ask. She had locked the library, she was sure of it.

“It’s Constanza!” The boy exclaimed, out of breath “He’s the one kidnapping people! He does something to them in the PleaseCogs, and then kidnaps them when they start going crazy!”

“Olin, what is the meaning of this?” She asked, as she saw the butler rushing upstairs behind the boy.

“I’m afraid he’s right, mamzel,” He said “However crude his manners” he added, giving Rien a reprimanding look. The boy looked around, and stood there, frozen. “Both your father and his sister started displaying symptoms when they started frequenting the PleaseCog bars”

“My father, in those cesspools?”

“Yes, mamzel, I’m afraid so. Your father is a man of many virtues, but he wasn’t perfect. The death of your mother, the loneliness, was eating away at him.”

Erika took a moment to digest that information. Her father, in a PleaseCog… It was a disturbing thought, and she tried to push it out of her mind. In any case, she had a very strong lead now.

“Thank you, Olin, but next time, don’t hide these things from me. And you, boy,” Rien snapped to attention, visibly scared “Well done. Here, take this.” She handed him a credit chit with some money. The boy’s eyes widened when he saw the number in the display. “Olin, please escort him out. I’ll go visit this Constanza tomorrow.”

“Actually, mamzel, I think it would be a good idea if you took the boy with you. He obviously has some skill, and this Constanza seems to have some means. I don’t think these five downstairs were the only ones he has under his employ.”

Erika considered the butler’s proposal. On the one hand, the boy had been in her way ever since she had stepped down the ship. He had been an nuisance, and he was reckless and inexperienced. On the other, he *had* managed to break into her house somehow, and he seemed different to all the other gangsters she’d found. Plus, as much as she hated to admit it, this time he *had* saved her life.

She looked at him in the eye, considering him seriously for the first time since they’d met. She could see fear, desperation… but also something else. There was a fire, an unwavering determination, that reminded her of her days in the Academy. She decided that she could grow to like him. He was still incredibly annoying, though.

“All right, Olin, you win. Show him to one of the guest rooms, he will spend the night here.”

“Of course, mamzel. Come along, boy.” It took the boy a second to process what was happening, but after that they both dissappeared down the hall, and Erika closed the door behind her.

Tristan was already sleeping on the bed “Rest well, dear.” Erika told the cat “Tomorrow, we prepare to get some answers.”

# Disguise

It was dark. Not the kind of shadowy dimness that Rien was used to, but utter, lightless, dark.

He looked around, but he couldn’t tell one direction from another. In the distance, he heard echoes. Footsteps, coming towards him. The arrythmic, muffled footfalls indicated that someone was dragging themselves towards him. A voice called for him. A familiar voice.

“Rien… Rien, help me, please…”

*Cel*.

Immediatly, Rien ran towards her. As he got closer, he noticed the smell. The metal tang of blood, mixed with a putrid stink. The approaching footsteps sounded… wet.

“I’m coming!” He was frantically stumbling in the dark, trying to focus on the source of the voice.

“Rien… come here, brother…. help… me…”

It was so close, Rien could almost feel her.

*There!* A click echoed through the space, and he saw a light coming from above.

It revealed a figure. The figure of his sister. He accelerated, panting, muscles burning with pain.

As he got closer, he saw. She… *It,* wasn’t his sister. Rien could still see remnants of her round face and slender frame, but that… thing, that mass of rotting meat that shambled towards him, wasn’t his sister anymore.

“Rien… Come… here!” As it said that, the thing jumped towards him. He rolled to the side and avoided it narrowly, sploshing in the floor drenched in goo. He ran, desperatly, tears in his eyes.

The mass followed him, arms stretched, splotching its way ever closer. Wet, crunching noises marked its every step.

“Come… brother! Give me a hug.”

Rien was out of breath, he could barely feel his legs through the pain. It was gaining on him. Soon, he would need to rest, and it would catch him.

“Help… me!” The thing was angry, Rien could almost feel its breath behind him.

In his confusion, he tripped with his own feet, and tasted the concrete. The monster leapt after him, pinning him to the cold floor with its weight. Rien tried to wriggle out of its grasp, but it was a lot stronger. Its face now hovered over Rien’s. Gooey drops of blood and pus dripped from a myriad of infected wounds, splashing onto Rien’s face. He started crying.

“Why don’t you help me, brother?”

The monster’s face was so close Rien could taste its deathly breath.

“Why did you leave me to die? You made me this way.”

He closed his eyes and let out a scream of terror.

"This is all your fault."

He continued screaming, even as he woke up in the guest room of Belcroft Manor.

Panting, he looked around. He was in a bed. A very comfortable one, with white linen sheets and a holofire burning in the corner. Through a big glass window, the sun drifted into the marble flooring.

Rien heard a knock.

“Is everything alright, boy?” Olin asked through the closed door.

Rien tried to compose himself. He was panting, and his hair was thick with sweat.

“Yes, sorry.” He answered.

“Right. Take a shower and get dressed, please. Mamzel Belcroft is waiting downstairs.”

It took Rien a moment to figure out where his clothes were, and more than a moment to find out how to operate the strange bath. Down in the Grid, people used the public cleansing stations to keep clean. This was nothing like that. Instead of a cold dish with a pressurized spray of recycled water, the showerhead rained clean, warm, soapy water that relaxed Rien’s muscles, almost making him forget the night’s terrors.

He thought of his sister. Olin had helped him transfer the money to their account the previous night. That would be more than enough for Cel to live on for a while. She was going to be okay… right? He needed her to be okay for a while, until they could help her.

Water running through his skin, he stayed there a few more moments. His worries almost faded away. Almost.

---

Erika sipped from her cup. The warm, slightly acidic taste of light caffeine refreshed her, waking her up. *It’s not so bad to be back here*, *after all,* she thought, smelling the rich aroma that had now filled the room. If there was something her father had always prided himself in, it was having the best caffeine on the hill. *There’s nothing like this on the frontline.*

She was in a good mood.

She was sitting in the tea room, a lavish display of baked goods and cold meats in front of her. Olin was sitting in front of her, enjoying his own cup. Her arm still itched from the night before, but the servos had done a decent job of patching her up.

“You know, Olin, I had almost forgotten how good you were.”

“Thank you, mamzel, but it was the servos that brewed this batch.”

“I mean for yesterday. You wouldn’t be interested in returning to the frontlines, would you? With ten like you, the war on Coulomb 5 would be over in a month.”

Olin smiled to himself, as if remembering.

“I’m afraid not, mamzel. I left too many things in the fields. Things that one doesn’t recover from. I need to cherish the few I have left.”

Erika knew what he was talking about. She had seen many lose comrades, friends, even family sometimes. She hadn’t, or at least not yet. Nobody worth the tears, at least.

“I had to try.”

“I understand.” Olin’s mood seemed dampened by memories. Erika wondered what he had lost, and realized that she didn’t know much about his time as a soldier.

“Olin?” This was as good a time as any to start.

“Yes, mamzel?”

“What happened? Before you joined us.”

Olin smiled. He was about to respond, but at that point they heard a racket coming from the staircase. A second later, Rien burst from the door to the tearoom.

“Sorry! I lost track of time! I’m really sorry” He said, panting. His hair was still dripping all over the floor.

Erika looked at Olin, slightly amused. A look was enough for both of them to agree silently *Another time, then.*

“It’s nothing,” Olin said. The caffeine was too good for Erika to be in a bad mood. “take a seat, but mind the carpet”

Rien realized the mess he was making, and darted upstairs for a towel.

---

"Well, now that we’re all here." Erika started, once the boy was sitting at the table. He ate with ferocity, devouring plate after plate like he hadn’t eaten in days. Erika ventured that it was not a very far off guess. “This is how we’re going to do this. I agree with you boys that Constanza seems to be behind all of this. The question is: How do we prove it? He’s got dealings with the Corp, so they won’t move unless we have hard evidence. And even then, I'm still not sure they would risk it."

"What about the Empire?” Olin asked “Wouldn’t that Inspector Trygon be interested? He can probably bring the Enforcers down on Constanza.”

"I don’t think that’s a good idea, Olin. Remember that they have father. I don’t think the Empire will care to let these people go once they ‘rescue’ them, especially if they are potentially dangerous. Look at what they did to that Faustus. If what you say is true, father and the boy’s sister are headed down the same path as him."

At the mention of his sister, Rien stopped mid-chew. He stared at a half-finished toast, in somber silence. Erika continued.

“I think our best bet is to find evidence that Boch and the Corporation can’t ignore. They may have dealings with the gang, but once this cuts too much into their profits they won’t be so lenient about it.”

“Fair enough,” Olin agreed. “how do you propose doing that, mamzel? You’re the strategist here.”

“We will use the boy.” She said. _"The boy"_ raised his eyes, surprised, toasted bread still dangling from the corner of his mouth.

“His name is Rien, mamzel.”

“Right, Rien. I know firsthand that going in directly won’t work. Stop smiling, Olin, it’s not funny anymore.” He didn’t. “We’ll have to infiltrate their base. Olin and I will pose as wealthy off-worlders that are looking to open a PleaseCog bar, and want Constanza’s help. Rien, you will be our aide. Once we’re in, we’ll keep him entertained for a while. It’s your job to sneak into their base, and open as many doors as possible. Look for incriminating evidence. Comms transcripts, picts, dataslates, anything.”

Rien looked terrified.

“Me? Sneaking around Constanza’s base?” Erika had only seen the kid that scared once before, and that time he'd been afraid of her.

“Well, you’ve been there before, haven’t you?”

“Yes, once. When they gave me the assignment to… you know” He signalled to the lobby with his head.

“And you can definitely sneak about if you want to. You fooled Olin here.” The butler looked surprised for a second, before catching Erika's signal. _I know he didn't, Olin, just play along_. Rien didn’t seem fully convinced, but Erika could see that determination appear again in his eyes. *He’s in,* she thought. Using the child wasn't her proudest moment. _But needs must_, she thought _and I'll do whatever is necessary_. “How do we get there, Rien?”

“Well, the base has many entrances. It’s built below Pleasure Level 150, a series of hollowed-out abandoned habs connected by passageways. Almost every PleaseCog bar has an entrance, but the one I know is through *The Interchange*."

"What interchange"

"_The_ Interchange, mamzel. It's the name of a dealer kiosk.”

“We’ll take that one, then. There’s just one more problem. They know us. They definitely know how I look, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they remembered Rien as well.”

They all stopped to think, while the sound of Rien’s chewing filled the room.

“I know!” Rien exclaimed, pieces of unswallowed toast flying from his mouth. “My friend Luci can help.”

Erika raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

“He was the one who taught me to break locks. He and my sister used to be in a…” He hesitated, and looked at Olin. The butler nodded assuringly “… in a crew together. He’s retired now, but he will know how to get convincing costumes.”

Erika pondered that for a second. Letting someone else know about her plans was a risk. On the other hand, Rien had proven capable, which meant that his teacher was probably very useful as well.

“All right. We meet that friend of yours. However, we can’t be seen in the Grid for now.” Truth be told, Erika wanted to delay returning to that place for as long as possible. “Rien, can you get a message across to this Luci?” Rien nodded. “Tell him to meet us in the Grand Archive magtram station. Olin will pick him up and bring him to the mansion.”

"And what do I do in the meantime?" Rien looked eager to do something. Anything.

“I don't know. Go explore. But don’t break any locks this time, please. Just ask me if you need a door opened.”

---

A few hours later, Erika had a very old, very angry man in her living room. He was gaunt, his eyes sunk in their sockets. He had an augmetic leg that chirped with every step he took, and was carrying a big plastek messenger bag. And he was screaming at Rien.

“What are you doing with this bunch, boy! I told you yo stay away from them! I told you, they’re bad news! Had to come all this way here just to put some sense in you.”

“Listen, Luci, these people want to help Cel.”

“Help Cel my ass! Look around you, boy. These are Corp dogs. They don’t give a damn about us normal people.” Apparently, the feeling was mutual. Erika was spectating this exchange. She was right there, she could hear everything, but that Lucitav man didn’t seem to care.

“Luci, calm down please” Rien _did_ care, and he looked at both of them nervously. Erika was amused, but didn’t show it. “Look, miss Belcroft here has lost someone too. Her father. If you don’t believe they care about us, believe they care about that. We want to bring Constanza down! But we need your help. Think about Cel, please Luci.”

Lucitav stopped to think.

“Alright, I buy that. Looks like Constanza has messed with the wrong people now.” He turned to Erika. “I still think you’re a corporate dog, and I still don’t like you. I’m doing this for the boy.” Erika could understand that, but she didn’t much care. The man was going to cooperate, and that was all she needed. “If you let something happen to this boy, I swear I will find a way to make you pay.”

Erika wasn’t so sure about that, but she respect the man’s courage.

“The boy is here on his own will, old man. He has committed to this himself. He’s no use to us dead. Besides, the more you help us, the safer he will be.”

The man mumbled something under his breath, and turned to rummage for something in his bag. He pulled out a small pouch, and handed it very carefully to Erika. She opened it, and inside were four syringes, filled with clear liquid.

“Face Meshes” He explained, dryly. “Marsha used them a lot in our jobs.”

“What do they do?” Rien asked.

“I’m sure the lady here can explain” Answered Lucitav. He was testing her.

She was going to pass.

“I’ve seen them once or twice before.” Erika answered. “It’s a mild neurotoxin. It will cause contractions and relaxations in the muscles of your face, making you appear as someone else.”

"Ugh. So, how will I look like?" Rien asked.

“It’s impossible to determine. The contractions aren’t severe, but everyone’s face reacts differently. I’ve heard it doesn’t hurt, though.”

Lucitav chuckled “You heard wrong, *lady.*" he said, grinning mischievously "It’s a very painful experience. The serum floods your nerve endings. For the first moments, you'll wish you could tear your skin off, just to stop the burning."

Rien's face lost its color. Erika simply shrugged. "It's all the same. This is too useful to pass up. Thank you, Lucitav."

“I’m not doing it for you, I’m doing it for the boy. Just bring him back in one piece. And you, boy.” He turned to Rien. “I hope you know what you’re doing. Your heart is in the right place, but I don't know where your head is. Your sister needs you right now. Breathing.”

“Don’t worry, Luci” Rien said, “I can take care of myself.” but Erika could see there was something troubling him whenever his sister was mentioned.

---

A few minutes later, Olin had taken the man back to the station. After that, he'd be off to procure some off-world clothes. Erika pulled Rien aside.

“Listen, boy. I know you’re worried about your sister. But you have to believe, this is the way we’re going to help her. You know that, right?”

Rien nodded weakly “… right.”

That wasn't what she wanted to hear.

“Look at me.” She said, with all the patience she could muster. “We need you for this job. Without your help, we have no way of getting the evidence we need to finally bring Constanza down and help your sister.” She knew she was using his emotions, but she wasn't lying either. “Tomorrow, we go to Constanza. For now, rest. And most of all, don’t do anything stupid, okay?”

Rien nodded weakly, and drifted off to the guest room.

---

*This is stupid,* Rien thought as he jumped out of the manor window. In the cold of the night, the trees seemed as menacing as ever. *But I have no choice. I have to check on Cel.* He ran, hiding amongst the bushes of neighbouring houses. He believed nobody had noticed him, but he couldn’t be sure. *It will only be a quick look, I’ll be back before they know it!* He thought, as he arrived at the magtrain station that connected Decorat together. Ever since his dream, he hadn’t been able to shake the feeling that Cel was in dange. *Just pop in, make sure Cel got the money, and see if she’s okay.*

He hopped on the train, and it started moving downhive, to his sister.

When he arrived to his hab, he couldn’t believe his eyes. It was empty. No, not only empty. It was trashed. The door was smashed open. The little furniture they had was bent and overturned. Worst of all, Cel wasn’t there. Something had happened here, something big.

He felt a hard hit to the back of his neck, and he fell to the floor.

“Well, well, well. Look who’s survived. You’ve got some explaining to do”, said the old woman’s voice. “Igor, We’re taking him too.”

Rien had just enough time to realize his mistake before another hit on his head took him out.

# Answers

Erika scratched her arm, where she had been shot two nights ago. The wound was mostly closed, but it still itched. And these off-world clothes weren’t helping, either.

“I’m only saying, Olin, that you didn’t have to get me a *dress*.” She said, waving her arms around. The long strips of fabric hanging from her sleeve spiralled in beautiful patterns. “This could get ugly, you know, and I can’t move in this thing.”

“If it does get ugly, mamzel, I’m afraid we’ll have bigger problems.” The butler responded from the driver’s seat of the rented grav-car “I apologize, but that is the fashion in the closest colonies. To dress otherwise would raise suspicion.”

Erika had to agree, but that didn’t make the dress any less annoying. Rien’s dissappearance the night before hadn’t left her in the brigtest of spirits, and the long layers of colourful floaty fabric weren’t helping. Where was he? Erika feared he had done something really, really stupid.

She couldn’t even bring Tristan, they had already seen him in *The Trujoi*.

She looked in the rearview mirror, and saw a face much older than she was. The Face Mesh had relaxed her forehead and cheeks, and now they were full of wrinkles. Her neck was a forest of varicose veins and skin flaps.

“We’re here, mamzel.” Olin started lowering the grav-car in front of an establishment called *The Interchange.* Little more than a hole in the wall, one of many in the Pleasure Levels.

“Right.” Erika snapped back to business. “Let’s recap. I’m Reina Valeria, a very rich, very bored aristocrat from Blyusk-5. They don’t know you, so you’re still Olin, my assistant. I want to set up a PleaseCog bar here, in Decorat, and I’ve heard Constanza is the person to ask.”

“Sounds delightful, miss Valeria.” As expected, Olin was thrilled by the concept of Erika looking older than him. “As per Blyusk custom, I will handle introductions, and you will take over when business talk starts.”

“Great. Since Rien is not here, we will have to manage to find evidence some other way. Do you remember the plan for that?”

“I do, mamzel. It’s risky, but I don’t see many other options.”

“There aren’t any. Let’s go, then”

They stepped out of the vehicle, and headed towards *The Interchange* . An old woman was attending it, reading an erotic zine in an old dataslate.

Olin approached and knocked on the steel counter three times.

“*On-egin,* my dear woman, well met!” He said, bowing deeply. Erika wondered where he had learned those mannerisms “My mistress, Reina Valeria of Blyusk-5 would like to speak to your master.”

The woman put down her zine, and looked at them intently. She examined them both, slowly, methodically. Keeping in character, Erika looked around, disinterested. After a long moment of silence, she picked up a comms-horn soldered to the bottom of her desk.

“You see them, boss? Yes, they say they’re from off-world. They say they want to do business. Yes, I know. Are you sure? Of course, sorry boss. Thank you.”

She hung up, and dissappeared from the small counter. A few moments later, a metallic door to their right opened with a loud clang, and the woman appeared from it.

“Come in. The boss is expecting you.”

Olin looked at Erika, a shadow of worry betraying his perfect impersonation. A look was all Erika needed to catch the message: *Something about the way the woman had talked to the boss seems… off.* Erika nodded. She had also noticed it, but there was no turning back. She didn’t think they would get a second chance, now that they knew her Face Mesh appearance. Damn, where the hell was Rien?

They ventured through the treshold into the darkness within. Behind them, the woman closed the heavy metal door. It clanged with a finality that Erika didn’t think possible from an inanimate object.

*Here we go*, she thought. *No way out now.*

Inside, Constanza’s base was a labyrinth of interconnected hallways, lit by bobbing hololights, most of them blinking from malfunctions. The base had been constructed from hollowed-out abandoned hab blocks, and much of the original distribution was still present. As a result, the hallways were very, very narrow. And none of them had windows. Erika could almost taste the pent up sweat and pheromones in the air.

At some point along the way, two guards joined them — a man and a woman, very muscular, with riot batons latched on their belts.

As soon as Erika got a closer look, she instinctively reached for her hidden gun. The woman had wounds on her face. Tristan’s wounds. These guards were the ones the ones that had messed her hand up in the *TruJoi*.

As Erika lifted her hand, the female guard noticed. Erika feigned an itch, trying to hide her reflex. *Not here*, she thought. She didn’t know what — or who — was inside that labyrinth, and she was sure there were more than a few eyes on them. Erika averted the gaze from the guard. After a few seconds, the guard did the same, but Erika noticed that her hand rested a lot closer to the baton now.

The place was clearly designed to keep people in. They would have been completely lost without the old woman.

Flanked by the guards, she guided them through door after door, corridor after corridor, inching deeper into the belly of this beast.

Most of the rooms were closed as they passed, but Erika caught a glimpse of a half-opened door. Inside, some adolescents wearing blast-masks were distributing a purple liquid into small ampoules. She didn’t know what that was, and decided she didn’t want to find out. The male guard noticed her interest, and slammed the door closed.

She mentally braced for what was coming. Without Rien, she would have to use an alternative way to get answers. The new plan was risky, and it depended entirely in them selling this charade. *Damn it,* she thought. *Where is that damn boy?*

---

“Reina Valeria, is it?” Said Constanza from his throne at the end of the room. The oversized chair hovered over the dusty concrete floor, holding a short, balding man. He had sharp features, and a fierce spark of intelligence shone from his eyes. Somehow, Erika wasn’t surprised. She suspected one didn’t get to be gang boss with muscles alone.

Unlike the rest of the base, the throne room was circular. The wall was lined with massive goons, with arms so big that Erika could almost smell the stimms sweating from their pores. They formed a perfect ring of muscle, and Erika and Olin were in the center of it. Behind them, the old woman left, shutting the only exit behind her.

“*Miss* Valeria, sir” Olin corrected with a confident reverence. Erika kept looking to one side, looking disinterested. “Milady comes from Bluysk-5, looking to form a partnership with you.”

“Sure thing, buddy. Miss Valeria. What kind of deal did you have in mind?”

“Milady would —“

“Didn’t ask you, pal.” Erika could feel the gaze of the brutes on them. “Listen, _your Grace_. Down here, it’s about respect. Without respect, this all goes to shit! This is just not going to work if we can’t talk to each other. If you want to do business here, you need to be respectful, and talk to me yourself.”

Erika was ready for this.

“Well good sir, if it’s about respect, then you won’t mind if you and I take this somewhere more… private” She said, still not looking at Constanza directly.

Constanza looked perplexed for a second. *It can’t be that easy*, thought Erika. Then the small man started laughing.

“Ha! Good try, Miss Valeria. I appreciate the confidence! This might turn out to be interesting after all. But look around you. It’s not me who has to show respect.”

Erika smiled her most convincing smile, and finally turned to the boss.

“It was worth a try, indeed. Nice to meet you, Mr. Constanza." She curtsied, as best she could under that dress "Now that it’s all cleared up, could we talk business?”

“Sure thing! What brings you to my little place? I hear you’ve come a long way to talk business.”

“Let me be honest with you, Constanza. Can I call you Constanza?”

The man nodded.

“I’m bored. Up there, in the colonies, there’s *just nothing to do!”*

“I can imagine, dear” Constanza was smiling broadly.

“So I’ve had the most wonderful idea! I’ll set up my own little bar, down here in the capital! I hear you’ve got the most… stimulating entertainments!”

“That we do. What kind of entertainment would you be looking for?”

*Now we lean in, very close, and we whisper* “I hear you have” *Pause for effect* “PleaseCogs” Erika let out a juvenile laugh, as if she was embarrased by the very idea.

*He seems amused,* Erika thought. *This is going well.*

“I see! Nothing wrong with a little fun, isn’t that right? And if we can make some money in the process, well, even better!” Constanza winked at Erika, and she tried to repress the urge to punch him in the face. Instead, she smiled as flirtatiously as she could.

“Indeed, my dear Constanza! I see we understand each other.”

“Of course! Now, before we get into the details, what do you say we a toast, eh? You know, to start this… relationship on the right foot.”

*No way I’m drinking anything you give me, you snake.*

“That would be lovely!” said Erika “There is this small matter, though. A trifle, to be sure. Our informants have told us that there’s been some trouble in the Pleasure Level lately.”

“Oh, have they?” *He looks surprised, that’s good. “*And what exactly do they say?”

*Now for the coup-de-grace*

“They say there are…” *gasp* "people missing!”

“Do they now?” *That’s the spot*, Erika thought as she saw a flicker of doubt pass over Constanza’s face. She zoomed in with her implant, ready to record every inch of the man’s expression. “Of course, some people come and go, my dear Valeria. But that can hardly be the fault of honest entertainers like us, now, can it?” *Of course it can, you bastard* “So what if there are a few more disappearances every now and then? So what if we have a couple of… malfunctions? At the end of the day, you and I will make a lot of money”

*I got you,* Erika thought. *Now, to get out of here.*

“Indeed, dear Constanza. That’s absolutely right.”

A pile of muscle with vaguely human shape approached with a tray and two cups.

“Thank you.” Constanza said, handing a cup to Erika. “No, please stay, Igor. See, miss Valeria, this is Igor. One of my best men. He is efficient, strong, and most of all, very loyal. If there’s one thing I can’t stand, is disloyalty.”

“I can always admire someone who keeps their employees happy” Erika said.

“Right. Are you happy here, Igor?” The giant nodded. “Amazing, isn’t he? Now, back to the point. You see, down here, sometimes people borrow money. In fact, they often borrow money. From me. And plenty of people borrow more than they can pay back! Can you believe that?” Constanza started pacing around the room “Igor here helps me with those people. He’s very efficient, although sometimes he can be quite... heavy-handed. Now, why does this matter? Well! Turns out, we’ve had just one such problem customer lately. He’s been _very_ problematic, let me tell you. We even gave him a second chance! We helped him *work* to repay his debts.”

*Oh, crap. “*That’s wonderfully generous of you.”

“I know, right? Even Igor felt good about sparing them! He *looked* like such a good boy, you know? We sent him to do a very simple job. You know, your usual hit. On a rich lady who was asking too many questions.”

*Rien, what have you done?*

“When none of the hit team returned, we assumed he was dead with the others! _Oh well_, I tell myself, _those things happen_. But, lo and behold, Igor found him last night! Here, bring him in! Igor was very sad to see that they had betrayed his trust, weren’t you Igor?”

The doors behind Erika opened, and they pushed Rien inside. The boy stumbled and fell to the floor before them. He was beaten up, one of his eyes swollen. *Oh, no… you stupid, stupid boy.* Erika resisted the urge to grab her gun. She could see that Olin was having a much harder time doing the same thing. The butler was livid with contained rage.

“Now, now.” Constanza said, grabbing Rien’s face to examine the damange. He used his thumb to wipe some blood off the boy's cheek. “What are we going to do with you? See, I’m a good man, Rien, but Igor here was really hurt by what you did. Heck, *I’m* really hurt for what you’ve done!” He let Rien’s face drop, and it hit the floor with a mute thud. The boy groaned, semi-conscious.

*We still have a chance*, thought Erika. *If we doesn’t know yet, we can still have the element of surprise.*

“I’m going to have to let Igor take care of you. I’m sorry, but I don’t have a choice.”

Igor started stepping towards Rien.

Erika’s hands itched, ready to spring to action. If he got any closer, she could grab him…

“But here’s what’s been bugging me” Constanza said, as he stopped just out of reach of Erika. “Here I am, debating what to do with this boy, right? But I’m missing the most interesting part! See, the woman he was supposed to kill was asking questions about PleaseCogs too, miss Valeria! Just like you! Isn’t that a fun coincidence, how you appear here, not two days later?”

Erika wiped the smile off her face. *He knows.* Without hesitation, she reached for her gun.

She didn’t get to it in time. The guard from before, with the scarred face, grabbed her from behind, immobilising her in a choke hold. Olin had suffered the same fate.

“Now, now, mamzel Belcroft, don’t need to be hasty!" Erika could swear his manner was changing, "I admit, I was impressed of how you managed to deal with some of my best people. And the Face Meshes were a nice touch too! I’ll admit, if it wasn’t for the boy, I probably would have fallen for it! But alas, it was not to be.”

Erika tried to kick the guard, but all she got was a slap to the face.

“Woah! No need to be hasty! There will be plenty of time to talk. Igor, please do your thing.”

Igor's fist hit her square in the jaw, and Erika felt her world spinning as she fell down, unconscious.

# Pain

Erika’s head throbbed as she tried to open her eyes. One of them did, but the other refused with the fiery insistence of inflamed tissue. It didn’t do much good, either. She was sitting in a room, alone, and a single burning light above her enveloped the corners in shadows. Besides her own grunting, the only sound she could hear was the rhythmic trickle of water from a leak on the roof.

*That boy,* she thought. *That reckless idiot of a boy. You just had to sit tight for a night. One night! And this wouldn’t have happened.* As angry as she was at Rien, she couldn’t help but feel a little bit sorry for him. That kid’s dedication to his sister was commendable, it was clear he would do anything for her. But that didn’t make it any less stupid.

She evaluated the damage. They had taken all her weapons, and tied her up to a steel chair. The right side of her face was inflamed, probably because of that Igor’s slap. Her wrists were sore from where they have grabbed her, and she probably had a few bruised ribs from the punches. Besides that, she was mostly okay. Lucky. If they had treated Olin the same way, they were in mostly good shape, all things considered.

She tried to squirm out of the bonds, but they were military-grade. She tried to move the chair, but it was bolted into the ground. No way out. She’d have to get out of this one by talking.

That is, if someone ever came.

*They haven’t killed us yet,* she thought. *Why?*

She was musing on this when she heard a door behind her open. Two sets of heavy boots stomped in, followed by another set of quick, darting steps.

“It seems, mamzel,” Constanza said as he approached. “that we are in a bit of a pickle.”

He waited a few seconds for Erika to respond, but she kept her head down. They had kept her alive for some reason. They were fishing for something, and she wasn’t going to give anything away for free.

“You see,” He continued “despite the appearances, I don’t *really* want to hurt you. In fact, I don’t want to hurt anybody!”

Erika couldn’t help but scoff. Loudly.

“You don’t believe me? Lots of Sagitar dogs don’t believe me, but for some reason I hoped you’d be different. That’s… disappointing, but I’ll live with it.”

“And why would we ‘Sagitar dogs’ believe you?”

“That’s not the question though, is it? The real question is — why *wouldn’t* you? You rich people are so used to stabbing each other that distrust is always your first response. I never lied to you, or even to the boy! Sure, I have been… rough, at times, but never *dishonest*. That’s not how things are done down here, and it’s more that can be said for you.”

Erika could feel the menacing breath of two tall people behind her. Constanza grabbed a metal chair from the dark corners of the room, and pulled it closer. The chair’s legs screeched loudly as he dragged it in front of her. He sat down, and crossed his legs, calmly. There was less than a meter of air between them, which was quickly taken over by the sbutly rancid smell of Constanza's sweat.

“But this is all besides the point, isn’t it? You’re just trying to gain an edge on me, something that will get you out of this one. You’ll try to make me mad, I will say something I shouldn’t, and you’ll somehow use it as leverage. Well, that’s not going to happen. Mostly because this is a Faraday cage behind 30 meters of radioinsulating rockrete, there's just no way you could send a signal in or out. But also because, believe it or not, I don't really want to kill you.”

“And why is that?” Erika tried again. She had a suspicion about it, but she wanted to hear it from him.

“Well, I’m sure you have some ideas by now. But that’s not really the point. The point is that I could, and I haven’t. I have some questions, and the only way I’m going to keep *not* killing you is if your answers convince me. If I suspect you’re not telling the truth, my associates here will let you know. They are still angry about that kerfaffle in the *TruJoi*. Sound fair?”

Erika heard someone pop their knuckles behind her, and smiled dryly. They both knew that was as fair as it was going to get.

“Right. First question. Why are you here?”

“Because you tied me up” Erika answered. A brutal punch connected with her gut, and her stomach turned. She felt sick, but she managed not to vomit.

“This is not how we make this thing work, you know? I know I wasn’t specific enough, but that was still a very bad answer.”

Erika was doubled over, gasping for air.

“Let’s go again. Why are you here, in Decorat?”

“I’m on vacation” Erika said, looking at Constanza in the eye.

Another punch, and Erika thought she was going to pass out. Constanza seemed unfazed.

“If I didn’t know better, I’d say that you’re enjoying this! Let’s try another way. When you came into my club, you wanted to ask for someone. Who was it?”

“*Well,*” Erika repeated Constanza’s words, between laborious breaths “*I’m sure you have some ideas by now.*” She coughed, spitting a mixture of bile and blood on the floor. “*But that’s not really the point, is it?*”

Constanza seemed amused. “Clever! I have to admit, you’re even tougher than I thought!” He signalled someone behind him, and Erika felt a third punch. Her kidneys flared in agony. She tasted bile on her throat. She was finding it hard to stay awake now. “Here’s my hypothesis. Please tell me if I’m going in the right direction. You’re obviously military. You have fantastically bad street manners, too bad to have lived in Decorat for very long. So, Expansion Corps, recently landed from a mission?”

Erika was surprised. If Constanza was still *guessing* that, Rien hadn’t told them as much as she thought.

“From your face I see I’m right. See how easy this is when you cooperate?” Constanza was sitting back, eyes fixed on her. Erika didn't respond, too busy trying to keep her mind afloat in the sea of adrenaline.

“Now, everybody knows that there’s only two ways someone from the Corps comes back — dead, or retired. You don’t seem old enough or broken enough to be retired, and you’re obviously not dead. So, Sagitar must have had a good reason to bring *you* here. They obviously don’t care about you that much — otherwise, they’d already be knocking on my door — but they still believe that you’ll do what they want you to do. You’re capable, motivated, and expendable. Is that right?”

Erika didn’t answer, which Constanza seemed to take as an affirmative.

“Now, mamzel. Here comes your opportunity. I need you to stop doing what you’re doing. Simple as that. Believe me, it will be better for everybody if you stop asking around. If you tell me what the Corporation is motivating you with, I will double it. The only thing you have to do is _stop looking_.”

So that was it. He *was* doing something that would upset the Corporation, and he knew that if he killed her, they wouldn’t stop coming. Erika had something to go with. She couldn’t turn them over to Sagitar before getting her father back, but she could probably use this to bargain her way out.

“They promised me my father. He disappeared, and I know you have taken him. Like you have taken Rien’s sister, and thousands like them. You make them lose themselves in your damned PleaseCogs, and then kidnap them.”

Constanza’s eyes widened with surprise. Then he started pacing around the room, muttering to himself. After a while he stopped and, without a word, darted out of the room.

Erika stayed there, head low, surrounded by the two guards.

After a few seconds, Constanza returned. He looked winded, but decided.

“The boy’s version is consistent with yours. The other man… well he’s even more stubborn than you are!” Erika felt a sting of guilt, thinking of what they would be doing to Olin. He was loyal to a fault, but he was suffering because of her. Constanza caught her expression.

“Oh, don’t worry! The moment I figured out this whole mess, we stopped… asking. He still breathes. Somewhat.” Through the sweaty strands of hair covering her face, Erika shot him a hard look. “Don’t look at me like that, I *did* ask you to cooperate, look how much nicer everything is when you do! Now that I know what’s going on, we can all work together I believe that people are moved by motivation. Here’s yours.”

He handed a dataslate to Erika. It showed her father, lying on an unmade, filthy bedroll. He seemed to be sleeping. The image wasn’t clear, but Erika could still see how hollow his skin had become, and how his eyes had sank in their sockets. Seeing her father like that almost brought a tear to her eye. Almost.

“What have you done to him, you bastard!” She snapped at Constanza.

“Nothing! I need you to believe me, mamzel Belcroft, but we’re only trying to help your father.”

“By poisoning him in those damn PleaseCogs? By putting him into a cell?” Her bindings bit into her wrists as she tried to wrestle free. She was going to kill that ninker.

“*We* didn’t poison him.” Constanza seemed almost offended by the notion. “Why would we do that? Think about it, Belcroft. What do *we* gain from keeping him?”

Erika tried to get out of her bindings for a few more seconds, but her strength was leaving her. She tried to calm down, and think. Why did they keep them? Her father and Rien’s sister would end up crazy, like that poor devil. They would turn into lunatics, they were no use for an organized gang like Constanza’s. Even if they didn’t kill them, they would be better served by just letting them go, so that they ended up captured by the Enforcers. At that moment, she knew the answer.

Erika started laughing, which was quickly cut short by a cough of phlegm and blood.

“You don’t know either.” She said, “You don’t know why they get sick in your PleaseCogs! You just know they do. If you don’t get them, the Enforcers will, like that Faustus, and then it’s only a matter of time before they track them down to your gang.”

Constanza smiled. “Exactly. And here lies our opportunity for cooperation. You want to solve this as much as we do, and you can go places we can’t. We should help each other.”

“There’s still something I don’t understand.” Erika continued “why not just kill them? I can imagine it’s very taxing on your operation to keep that many people alive.”

“It’s exhasperating to explain this over and over again, Belcroft. We don’t want to kill unnecessarily. Those poor people have done nothing to offend us. In fact, they were good customers, and most of them even were good people! Their only crime was wanting a break from the world. And look around, Belcroft. Who can blame them for that?”

Erika was surprised. These gangsters had been very tough on her and her friends but, looking back, she realised *she* had always struck the first blow. Maybe they *could* cooperate after all…

“Now that you understand, I want to take you to your father. As I said, I believe in motivation, and I think that will motivate you to not reveal our operation, unless you want the Enforcers to take him.”

Erika still didn’t know what to believe. On the one hand, these were the same people that had beat up Rien, and had sent people to kill her, at her home. On the other, Constanza was so open and logical in his self-interest that she had a hard time *not* believing him.

“Fine. I’ll go.”

“Good!” He directed to the guards “Please, help mamzel Belcroft out of that chair.” As the guards started to untie her, he added “Oh, just in case you try to do something stupid. Remember that I don’t *want* to hurt your father, but that doesn’t mean I *won’t*.”

Erika nodded, and the guards got to work on her bonds.

# Reunion

When she tried to get up, Erika’s head felt light and the floor spun beneath her. She grabbed onto the chair, which prevented her from falling. Narrowly.

“Ant, please help mamzel Belcroft.” Constanza said to the male guard. The guard looked at him, confused. “Don’t look at me like that! Yes, she beat you once, so what? That’s not my fault, is it? And if she can’t walk, she can’t help us.”

The guard grunted, and helped Erika get on her feet. After a few seconds, she was able to stand on her own. Actually moving, though, was a different story altogether.

“Great, now give her your baton. Yes Ant, I’m serious! Look at her! She can’t even walk! If you really think she’s dangerous now, then you’re useless and I might as well fire you.”

Erika accepted the baton from the mumbling guard, and used it to walk a few steps. She was starting to appreciate Constanza as a leader. He was incredibly practical. Tough, but fair. She thought the Corps could use officers like him.

She limped behind the guards, following them through the labyrinth of corridors, until they finally reached Constanza’s circular throne room.

“Wait here” The boss said, and disappeared back through the door.

Erika leaned against a wall, panting. She remembered the picture of her father, and wondered whether he was okay. *I hope it’s not too late.*

---

A few moments later, Constanza appeared through the door again, with more guards. Rien and Olin were behind him, and Erika felt a sting of guilt when she saw them. Olin was being carried by two thugs, his head bobbing and his feet dragging through the floor. Erika rushed to help him, replacing one of the guards. The weight of the butler’s heavy frame almost threw her off balance.

“Olin, I’m sorry it came to this…” She whispered.

“Don’t… worry, mamzel.“ He said, with a faint thread of voice. “you’re not the only one who wants to help master Belcroft” He tried to smile, but coughed drops of blood instead.

“They got him, Olin, but it’s not what we thought. They’re keeping him alive. We’re going to see him now.”

The butler didn’t say anything, but Erika felt him relax a little.

Rien wasn’t in much better shape, either, but he was walking on his own, at least. Erika could see parts of his face caked in dry blood. The boy’s gaze was fixed in some point in the distance. He didn’t seem aware of what was going on around him.

Olin must have caught her glancing at Rien, because he said:

“Don’t blame the boy, mamzel.”

“I don’t, Olin”

He tried to chuckle, but all that came out was a dry cough and a splatter of blood. "You would have done the same at his age."

Erika had to admit he was right. Maybe that’s why the butler liked him so much.

Constanza was impatient “Now that we’re all together, “ he said, “Brace yourselves.”

He pressed some buttons on his throne, and the whole room started to move. Erika could feel herself falling down. It was an elevator! The whole room was a big elevator, drilled right through the carcasses of old, stacked habs.

*Smart,* she thought. *By building it at the core of the hab-stacks, the they move up and down the levels without needing to go outside.* She was impressed. *They may be poor devils, but they are resourceful.*

---

After a few minutes, the whole room shook as it stopped with a loud thud.

When the door opened, a rush of hot air washed into the elevator chamber. The smog was thicker here, and the only wind were the slimy, suffocating currents of exhaust. Erika realized where they were.

“The ground level? You’re keeping them in the _ground level_?”

“Well, nobody will come looking for them here, will they?” Answered Constanza, nonchalantly. He was right, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t dangerous.

“You’re killing them by _keeping_ them here!” If the air on the Grid was bad, inthe ground levels it was downright poison. There was a reason these levels were deserted.

“I know that, Belcroft.” Constanza snapped “But look around you. It’s this or the Enforcers, and I know which one I would prefer. In case you haven’t noticed yet, we can only work with what we have.”

Erika didn’t respond. She understood Constanza’s thinking, but it was still a death trap.

“The sooner you help us fix this, the sooner your father — and these people — will be safe. Now, if you’ll follow me, I’ll take you to hospital.”

---

They called it a hospital, but it was more like a prison camp. Hab walls had been knocked down to form a big empty space. They had lined bedrolls in tight lines, and hundreds of people were lying there, unconscious. The rank smell of sweaty bodies and old urine filled the place. Dozens of attendants were fluttering around the bedrolls, checking on the sick and administering sedatives where necessary.

They split off in two groups. Two guards took Rien to meet with his sister, and the rest continued to see Erika’s father. They walked through the rows of groggy citizens, until they got to Jordan Belcroft’s bed. Erika didn’t like what she saw. She remembered her father as a broad-shouldered strong man, almost heavy set for his stature. The person lying on that stained bedroll was gaunt. Pale. _Weak_. Nothing but a ghost of that memory.

Olin indicated that he could stand on his own, so Erika rushed to her father’s side and grabbed his hand. It was cold, bony, lifeless. The only sign of activity she could see in her father was the faint raising of his chest with every laborious breath.

Erika was irate. Her father, in a place like *this*. She looked at Constanza, ready to lash at him. And she saw… sadness. And frustration.

“I don’t like it either, Belcroft” The small man said. “But it’s really the best we can do right now.”

Erika didn’t respond. The man’s honesty had taken her off-guard, and had disarmed her. She took a second to really look around and take in the scene. There were hundreds, thousands of sick people here, that would suffer the same fate as Faustus if they didn’t find a solution.

And still, they tried to take care of each other. Erika remembered Lizah’s worry with the working people of Decorat, and finally felt some of her sympathy for them.

“I will help you, Constanza. I’ll find out what’s making these people sick, and I’ll fix it.”

The boss seemed relieved.

“I was hoping you would say that —”

“But my father can’t stay here.”

“I think he should."

"Do you understand what it would mean if he stayed?" Erika was starting to raise her voice.

"Do _you_?" Constanza's out burst caught her by surprise.

Then, as suddenly as it had come, the rage left Constanza's features.

"You understand that, if he gets exposed to the Enforcers or the Inspectorate, we risk this whole thing crashing down, don’t you?”

“I understand, Constanza. I’ll be careful.” She finally had a chip to bargain with “But if you want my help, you’ll us take my father with us, and the boy’s sister if he wants to.”

“I was afraid you would say that.” Constanza sighed, and rubbed his temple.

He stood there a while, thinking.

“Look. Despite the appearances, I think your father will be safer here. But we could really use your help, Belcroft. As a gesture of good will, I will let your father go. But I don’t trust the boy. He’s too rash, and too quick to do things without thinking. His sister stays.”

Erika had to agree with Constanza. She appreciated Rien’s spirit, but she didn’t trust his discretion.

“It’s settled, then” She said, still holding her father’s hand. "Let's go home, father." She felt his hand grip hers, ever so slightly.

---

A few minutes later, Rien was sitting in the passenger seat of a borrowed gravcar, looking out of the window. He was angry. Angry at himself for leaving his sister for the second time. Angry that she was sick, and angry that he was powerless to help her. Angry that they had forced him to leave her there. But that was still his only choice, right? To help Erika find a way to help their families.

Tears dripped from his eyes, as they saw the Grid get smaller in the distance.

# Storm

After arriving to the mansion, they settled Erika’s father in his room. She stayed with him, while Olin took Rien to the library to allow the servos to look at their wounds.

“Come, young man. We’re both pretty beat up, eh? What do you say to a cup of caffeine?” The butler had said, in an effort to make Rien feel better. They had all felt his pain in the car ride home. Rien had accepted without questions, or really any other words at all.

Now, Erika was sitting beside her father, holding his hand for the first time in decades. His fingers felt cold and hard, not like the full, warm embraces she remembered from her childhood. For the first time since she had known about it, she let herself feel the pain of seeing her father like that.

“I will find out who did this to you, father. I swear.” She said, sinking into her chair. “I don’t know how, but someone’s going to pay for this.”

At that moment, she realized how much stress her body had gone through. She closed her eyes, and let a wave of exhaustion wash over her.

---

Something squishing her hand woke her up.

“Erika…”

Erika’s eyes snapped open. She hadn’t been asleep for that long, barely minutes.

“Erika, is that you?”

“Yes, father!” She said. Her father’s eyes weren’t open yet, but his breathing was stronger, and he was trying to move, slowly.

“Erika, what’s happening? Where are we?”

“You’re home, father, you’re safe.”

Her father lifted a trembling hand, and he caressed her hair.

“My Erika, I’ve missed you so much.”

Erika tried to respond, but words refused to come out. Instead, she just enjoyed the feeling of her father’s hand caressing her face.

It didn’t last very long. Suddenly, her father’s eyes opened wide, and his gaze fixated on her.

“It’s coming! Oh, no. It’s coming!” He squeezed Erika’s hand so hard, she thought it might break.

“Who’s coming, father?”

“The old evil, Erika! It will consume all of us, and it’s coming for me!” His eyes almost popped out of their sockets, and his face formed a grotesque grimace. “There’s no time. You need to know, Erika. You need to know that I lo —”

He never finished that sentence.

His body started convulsing violently, arms and legs flailing in the air, knocking down everything around him. Then, as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. Jordan Belcroft’s limp body thudded on the mattress, eyes wide open.

Erika was left there, perplexed, for an agonizing moment. Just a moment. Then, she reached instinctively for her gun, and pointed it at her father.

Suddenly, Jordan’s eyes rolled upwards, until only the white was visible. His torso lifted, as if pulled by invisible strings, and he looked straight into Erika’s eyes. When Jordan Belcroft opened his mouth, the voice that came out was anything but human.

“Good evening, Erika Belcroft” The voice was calm and slow, but the words gurgled with the slimy wetness of a beast growling at its prey. “We meet, at last.”

“Who are you?” Erika asked, although she knew the answer already.

“You know who I am.” Jordan’s mouth wasn’t moving, but the voice was coming out regardless. It sent chills down Erika’s spine, but she held strong.

“Kyriel” Was the only thing Erika managed to say.

“That’s right. I am here with a proposition, Erika Belcroft.” Jordan raised an inert arm towards Erika. “Join me. Together, we will instill order in this world. We will create a perfect society, where everyone is judged in their abilities. A fair world. Together, will make this world *see*.”

“Fuck off, you bastard.” She managed to keep her rage under control. Still pointing her gun, she answered “You’re the reason my father is like this. You’re the reason all those people are sick. Why the fuck would I want to join you?”

Kyriel’s voice cackled with a malice that made Erika’s bones chill. “Those people are dust specks in the vastness of the universe. They are nothing. They have *seen,* but they weren’t strong enough to *understand*. You are different. *You* are strong enough. You will… understand.”

“I don’t want to see anything from you.”

At that moment, Olin and Rien burst through the door. They froze, seeing the scene that was taking place.

“Get out!” said Erika, turning to them “He’s not my father right now!”

Kyriel took that opportunity. Jordan Belcroft’s hand grabbed Erika’s wrist. For a moment she felt something, *someone,* rummaging around her mind. She gasped involuntarily, as slimy tentacles dug deep into the back of her head.

“I see… Yes, I understand now.” Jordan’s hand released Erika “I was wrong. You’re just like the other ones… you will never *understand.* A pity.”

“Good!” Said Erika, panting. The presence in her mind was gone, leaving her only a terrible headache. “Now fuck off, and leave my father alone!”

Kyriel cackled again “Your father is already gone, Erika Belcroft. And soon, you will be too.”

Before she could respond, Jordan’s expression flipped. The vacant eyes were replaced by a mask of rage. With superhuman speed, he lept from the bed, flying across the room. He landed on top of the terrified Rien, tumbling him to the floor. Snarling, he wrapped his hands around the boy’s neck.

Rien’s feet were kicking, and Erika could see the boy’s hands grasping, scratching, trying desperately to get the beast off of him. He couldn’t get out of her father’s hold. Olin tried to grapple with him, but the enraged Jordan swatted sideways, sending him flying against a bookcase.

The butler’s body crashed against the pile of books with a crunch, and he didn't get up. 

Erika snapped out of her shock. With the same steel resolve that had kept her alive in the frontlines, she aimed at her father, and pressed the trigger.

The high-pitched sound of a single laser shot filled the room. Then, for a second, everything stood still. The snarling, the kicking, the punching, everything had stopped. The only thing left was Erika’s laboured breathing. After what felt like an eternity, Jordan Belcroft’s body slumped and fell on its side. A wisp of smoke drifted from the tiny entry wound between his eyes.

“Th-thank you” She heard Rien say, weakly.

Erika looked at the gun in her hands, but didn’t say anything.

---

Somewhere in Decorat, in a dark room shielded away from the citity’s nightlife, somebody spoke.

“You were wrong” Said a wet, throaty gurgle. “She won’t understand. Not yet.”

The figure, enveloped by shadows, took a while to answer.

“Erika Belcroft… You didn’t kill her, did you Kyriel?”

"Don’t worry… I didn’t kill *her"* There was mirth in Kyriel’s voice. The figure sighed, defeated.

“What did you do?”

“Her father. She brought him closer to us, and I could finally *see* him again. I went into his mind to speak to our friend Erika, and left rather… brusquely” Kyriel cackled dryly.

“You could at least try to hide how much you enjoyed this.”

Another long pause.

“If what you saw in her mind is true, she’s closing in on our plans. The experiment was a success, now we have to accelerate preparations for phase two. How many do we have?”

“Enough” Kyriel answered. “And more are seeing the truth each day.”

"Good… Soon, everybody will see what you’ve shown me. Everybody will *understand."*

“Yes…” For some reason, Kyriel’s voice sounded… hungry.

“Who were you talking to?” Asked a woman, opening the door.

The figure turned, slowly. The light coming through the open door shone on the figure’s face, and something in it made the woman retreat, stumble, and fall with a terror expression in her face.

“Oh, Dana. Poor Dana. I really wish you hadn’t heard that. You weren't ready yet.”

---

Rien had been sitting at the library’s bar for a while. Olin had joined him earlier, but shortly after he'd collapsed in one of the high-backed chairs in front of the holofire. Rien couldn’t blame him. Even with the painkillers and mending cream administered by the servos, he still felt all the bruised spots. In fact, he couldn’t feel much else. Worst of all, his neck was starting to bruise. He was finding it hard to speak.

In such a situation, alcohol was probably not a very good idea. But Rien wasn’t going to sleep before drowning that image of Mr Belcroft, eyes white, mouth drooling, pinning him to the ground.

He heard footsteps behind him. He tried to turn, but the only thing he managed to do was gettin a sharp pain in his neck.

Without a word, Erika sat beside him, and started pouring malt liquor in a glass. Her face was tough, even blank. The liquid rose beyond the single shot line, beyond double, even beyond triple. Finally, Erika stopped pouring right at the edge of the glass.

She tilted her head backwards, and swallowed the entire contents with a single, loud gulp. She banged the glass on the bar, and immediately started pouring another one.

“Don’t look at me like that, boy” She said, eyes fixed in front of her. Rien heard the usual harshness that made him a little scared, but also something else. Sadness.

“S-sorry” He managed to say through his bruised throat. He coughed once, to clear it. “How… how are you doing?”

“I don’t want to talk about it”

Her expression made Rien terrified to continue, but she did it regardless. He still felt partly guilty about the whole thing.

“It’s just that… well, I know how you must be feeling right no—”

“*I said,*” She growled “I don’t want to talk about it” Her chilling tone spoke louder than any shouting could. Rien got the message.

She slammed the second drink, but didn’t go for a third. Instead, they both stared at the holofire, in silence.

Eventually, Rien got the courage to speak again.

“Thank you.”

Erika’s posture eased a little. Just a little bit.

“I did what I had to do, kid. Somebody had to stop…*it.*”

“No, not for that. Well, yes, of course I’m glad you saved me, and everything. If it wasn’t for you, well… I…” It was hard to find the words. “… you know.”

“I know.”

“But that’s not what I meant! I meant, thank you for not being angry at me for the whole mess at Constanza’s”

Still with her gaze lost in the fire, Erika smirked. “Who says I’m not angry?”

“Well… I thought” That caught Rien by surprise. Was she still angry? But then, why save him? Why not leave him for Constanza’s men? Was she going to turn him in? Of course she was! Why keep him around, now that she'd found her father? She didn't need him anymore. But what would happen to Cel?

“Relax. I’m not angry. You should see the look on your face.” She chuckled.

Rien looked at her, stupefied. After a second, he started chuckling too. It hurt his throat, but it also felt better than all the painkillers.

They laughed for a while, but even that eventually died down, and they both stared at the fire again, in silence.

This time it was Erika that spoke first.

“You really love your sister, huh?” She asked Rien.

“Yeah, I…” It was painful to remember “I was just a kid when our parents died.”

Erika chuckled again “You’re _still_ a child, boy!”

“Hey!” He tried to look offended, and then he smiled again “Anyway. We had nowhere to go. She took care of us. She took whatever jobs she could, and it got us by. If it weren’t for her, we would have ended up in a gang somewhere. Not all of them are like Constanza’s, you know? Most are much, much worse. The point is, I owe her everything, practically. She hates to admit it, but it’s my turn to help her now.”

“Right. You have heart, kid. Just remember to combine it with your brain next time. It doesn’t matter how fast you run, if it’s in the wrong direction.”

Rien blushed. He had to admit, he had let his emotions run wild, and that had gotten him in deep trouble in the past. His bruised face and ribs were witness to that.

“I know it’s hard.” Erika continued “I tend to be a bit… forward sometimes as well. But you will learn that with time. You should have seen me before I joined the Academy. If it weren’t for Olin’s guidance, I would have gotten into very bad trouble.”

They both looked at the butler. He was sprawled on the armchair in a very undignified position. As if on cue, he started snoring loudly. Erika and Rien started laughing.

“You always mention the Academy, Miss Belcroft. How is it?”

She stared at the fire for a while, reminiscing.

“It’s… tough. They get you young, they drill you hard. They isolated us from everything as we entered. Phyisical preparation by day, strategy and science by night. Days are long, rest is short. But it’s not… bad, I wouldn’t say. After a while, they will specialize you in whatever you’ll be best at, and they will help you achieve your full potential. The Academy is where a lot of the Decoratian high ranks are made, actually. One of my old friends from those days is now Archive Master here.”

“Wow, that’s impressive!” The concept sounded very good. Figure out a goal, and work hard for it. No figuring out where they'd sleep next year, or what they'd eat. Your only worry being getting _good_ at something. It seemed so… different… from the live they lived.

Erika was too lost in her remembrance to catch Rien’s sad look.

“I think you would like it. Actually, boy, let me ask you — how come you’re not studying?”

“_What?_ You're kidding, right?”

“Yeah, why not? I’ve seen your skills with locks. You learn fast, and are adaptable. You could make a great officer one day.”

Rien was almost offended by that comment. Did she not realize?

“You don’t see, do you? How would my sister eat? Who would take care of her? Even if I didn’t have to take care of her, where would I get money for food? Clothes? A bed?” He realized he was standing up and confronting Erika. He sat back down, and calmed down. “Not all of us have these mansions, you know? It’s not that easy.”

Erika didn’t say anything for a while. Rien didn’t want to look at her.

“I’m sorry, kid. I’m starting to understand what Lizah was talking about.” That apology was enough for Rien.

“Who’s Lizah?”

“My friend, the Master Archiver. She said that… nevermind. The point is, I’m starting to see how Decorat really works.”

After a brief pause, Erika spoke again. There was resolve in her voice.

“…yes. It’s decided. After we kill that bastard Kyriel and save your sister and the others, you’re going to the Academy. We can’t afford you stealing around.”

Rien was grateful he still wasn’t looking at Erika, because his eyes started filling with tears. Things like these didn’t happen to people like him. But it was happening. For the first time since he could remember, he had something to look forward to.

# Dawn

Hunched over the counter, through a veil of alcohol and grief, Erika poured her umpteenth shot.

The holofire crackled beside her, but it was the only sound in the room. Olin and Rien had retired to their rooms long ago.

With a loud gulp, she downed the whole contents of the glass. Again. She had lost count long ago. In fact, she wasn’t sure she’d bothered to start counting.

But still the image of her father — or rather, her father’s face in that mask of rage and fury was imprinted on her mind.

*Not enough. I need another.*

She tried to fill another glass, but most of it spilled out. Her hands were trembling. She looked at them. They were shaking dropping the liquid all over the polished wood, and she couldn’t make them stop. Those hands had held the gun that killed her father. They had pointed it to the back of his head. They had squeezed the trigger. Those hands killed her father.

Before she realized what she was doing, the half-full glass was flying across the room. It crashed against the wall behind the holofire, spraying tiny fragments of glass everywhere. The liquor reached the projector, making it crackle with sparks of electricity.

“Fuck!” She screamed in frustration. A long, piercing scream, that emptied her lungs, and carried on for a while after that.

When she stopped, she was panting.

Her head was spinning, but she felt relaxed for the first time that day.

She looked up.

The first lights of dawn seeped through the courtains, applying a tincture of amber and gold to the room. Outside, it was a new day. The world was moving on, like nothing happened.

*It wasn’t just me,* she thought.

*Kyriel, you’re going to pay for this.*

She remembered feeling their presence in her mind. It, whatever it was, knew her now.

*Good.* She thought, her closed fists white with rage. *Then you’ll know who’s going to kill you.*

---

Erika caught herself tapping her fingers, restless. After the fiasco at Constanza’s, they didn’t have much more to go from. They weren’t about to turn the sick people to the Enforcers. Not until they found Kyriel, or whoever was behind that. And what — or who — was Kyriel? How does a mythical being of an alien race end up in thousands of people’s minds?

Erika had the painful feeling that someone had *put* it there. And she shivered to think of *why* someone would like to do that.

She was pondering this as she stepped down the stairs, towards Belcroft Manor’s basement. She was looking for Rien. They didn’t have a clear course of action for now, so Olin had taken it upon himself to make Rien as comfortable as possible. For some reason, the old butler seemed to care deeply for the boy.

In one of their tours across the mansion, Olin had shown Rien their basement workshop. It was full of all kinds of tools, tech scraps, and trinkets. The moment he saw it, Rien lost interest in practically anything else. Now, he spent most of his free time down there, doing stars knows what.

And that’s where she found him. Sitting across the room, hunched over something on a metal table, lit by a single hololight.

Erika cleared her throat. Rien didn’t seem to hear her.

She did it again, louder. Nothing.

Finally, she walked up to the boy, and she tapped him on the shoulder. Rien squeaked, and almost hit Erika with a torquewrench.

“Sorry! Sorry! You scared me!” Rien said, panting.

“You need to be more aware of your surroundings, boy. Someday, that’ll get you killed.”

“Right. Sorry” Rien said. He fell silent, waiting for Erika to say something. He was obviously itching to go back to whatever he was doing, but didn’t know how to say it.

Erika looked at the table.

“Isn’t that…”

“Yep!” Rien said “It’s the drone that I used to map the house when… you remember”

“What are you doing with it?”

“Oh!” Rien’s face lightened. “Look, here. It had a busted spatial tracking node, so I replaced it with this one you had lying around. And here, I boosted the image capture speed. Now it can capture a whole room in less than 5 seconds.”

“Good” Erika said. She didn’t really care about the drone, but Rien’s enthusiasm was contagious. She had to admit, it was almost nice to have him around.

“… and here” Rien continued “I think you’re going to like this. Put your augment in link mode, and press this button.”

Erika did so. Immediately, she saw Rien and herself, looking straight at her. She was seeing through the drone’s lens, just like she did with Tristan. She looked around. When she moved her augmetic eye, the drone moved up and down with it. She had direct control of it.

"Neat, huh?"

Erika unlinked herself from the drone.

“Quite! I have to admit, boy. I’m very impressed. Where did you learn all of this?”

Rien blushed. “Well, some of it I learned from Luci. He used to have a Cognitor repair shop, you know? So he taught me some basic stuff. The rest, I kind of just… figured it out, I guess.”

“Huh.” Erika was more impressed than she let on.

“There’s more! Wanna see?”

“Not now, Rien. I actually wanted to tell you something. We just got a call from Constanza. No, don’t worry, your sister is fine. He said he’s going to grant us access to the organization’s databanks, in case that helps us. I thought you might be interested.”

Rien’s eyes lit up, like he was being given the most amazing present.

“Yes! I’m very interested! I’ve been at it for a while, I have so many ideas! So, here’s what I’ve been thinking. We’ve got the people, right? We know they go to PleaseCog bars, right? But we don’t know which bars are the ones that cause them to get sick, and there are thousands of them, right? But here’s the thing! I bet these PleaseCog bars keep registries of their customers. I can cross-reference the list of sick people with the list of clients of all the PleaseCog bars! That *has* to give us some clues for where to start, right?” Rien stopped to catch a breath, and Erika smiled. “Sorry, I get too excited sometimes.”

“That’s alright” Erika said. “In fact, it sounds like a great plan. I will send you the details.”

As she was walking up the room, Erika reflected on Rien *If we hadn’t found each other by chance, this boy would have ended up dead in a ditch. With the right guidance, he’ll accomplish greater things than I ever will. And yet, if it weren’t because of this mess, the system would have missed him completely.* *What kind of world wastes such talent?*

---

“Close your mouth, young man” Said Olin for the umpteenth time.

“Shoddy” Rien answered. Bits of bread flew from his mouth. Some made it across the breakfast table, but most just stayed on his new shirt. He tried to swat them to the floor, but he only spread them further across his outfit.

Olin sighed, and started lecturing Rien on table manners. Again.

Watching them, Erika almost forgot what had happened in the last few days. Olin had a minor limp, but other than that, they were all recovering well. At least physically. There were other wounds though, ones that took a long time to close.

Somebody was going to pay for all of this.

Outside, the rich families of Decorat were preparing for the Rites of Data Entry. Erika could see a buzz of merchant cars in the otherwise quiet street. They were carrying dozens — sometimes, hundreds — of attires for the high class to try. The ceremony was a very important time in Decorat, and wealthy families had made a game out of competing to see who would wear the most extravagant clothes.

Faustus was out of his mind, but this was *real* madness. She remembered her mess uniform upstairs, and smiled. She was very happy to sit that madness out.

*However*, she thought, as more and more ships came and went. *The starports must be operating at capacity right now. The Corporation must be hurting.*

She hand’t reported the discovery yet, and she wasn’t inclined to do it before getting to the bottom of this. *We found the people, but in their state they’re no good to anybody.*

*No, it’s not just that s*he thought, surprised with herself. Maybe her talk with Lizah was sinking in, or maybe Rien had got to her, but she found herself actually *caring* for these people’s well being. And, somehow, she didn’t think the Corporation would do the same.

*Only one thing to do now. Let’s find that bastard Kyriel.*

She lifted the caffeine cup to her lips, and took a deep breath. The warm aroma spread through her nose and throat, irradiating into her chest. She felt her muscles relax, and her mind focus.

*Let’s recap the facts. Something happens in one’s life. Something so bad, that they need to lose themselves in PleaseCogs. They start going to these bars. At some point, they start having nightmares. They don’t stop going. The nightmares get worse, until they can’t sleep without the help of sedatives anymore. If nothing changes, eventually they become…* She thought of her father …*that.*

There was only one thing that could cause that kind of change, or something similar.

“But how does one catch Pod Disease in a PleaseCog?” She said it out loud, without realizing. Rien stopped feeding Tristan, and Olin stopped telling him off for it. They both looked at her.

“What’s Pod Disease?” Asked Rien.

“You call it the Shivers” Answered Olin.

“Oh.” Rien turned to Erika “And how does one get that?”

“Right” Continued Erika “The most common cause of Pod Disease is someone re-living a traumatic memory. That’s why high-clearance Operators have such a high turnover. They have to to fetch some horrible data. Some battlefield recordings, or the chilling vox-logs of a stranded space station running out of resources. They essentially re-live those things, and some of them get stuck in your mind. If you can’t shake them off, they stay in your subconscious, and come back when you’re sleeping. That causes lack of sleep, which makes you even more susceptible to those memories. The cycle gets worse, until you start believing you’re still in those memories.”

Rien wasn’t convinced. “But how would you get those kinds of memories in a PleaseCog? Aren’t the memories there supposed to be of…” His voice broke for a moment, and he blushed “… of *other* things?”

“Precisely my point. There’s another wrench, though. Kyriel.” Rien lowered his gaze. He still found it uncomfortable to think about what happened to Erika’s father. “The sick people seem to end up the same way, somehow obsessed with Kyriel. If they all end up the same way, then —”

“They’re all seeing the same memory!” Rien jumped. After a second of silence, he realized he had interrupted Erika. “Sorry.”

“That’s right. The question is, what memory are they seeing? Furthermore, Constanza’s gang controls all the memories that go in and out of the PleaseCogs. How did they let such a thing into their machines?”

That train of thought was interrupted by a message popping into Erika’s implant. When she read it, she couldn’t believe what she was seeing.

“You’ll have to finish that toast later.” She said, getting up.

“What is it, mamzel?” Olin asked.

“We are requested at Sagitar, immediately. Rien, get your things. A chancellor is dead.”

# Stakes

It stank.

Dana Atsuki’s body was sprawled on the unmade bed, and it stank.

Erika examined the body. Instead of the young, almost teenage face she had at the council meeting, Dana Atsuki’s face was now a map of wrinkles and age spots. She looked impossibly ancient.

*That’s what juvs will do for you*, Erika thought. *They’ll keep you young, but they don’t leave a pretty corpse.*

Juv treatments needed a living organysm to work. When the system shut down, they quickly burnt away from the bloodstream, speeding up the aging process and, subsequently, the decomposition. It stank.

But, then again, Dana didn’t care anymore, did she?

“Cause of death?” Erika asked, while she examined the wrinkles.

“Suicide, apparently” Chief Boch read from his dataslate “The scanners show a high concentration of Druema in her bloodstream. Entry puncture is in the right arm.”

“Huh” There it was, indeed. Just a little red dot, right at the start of the forearm. From that red dot, the characteristic purple lines of Druema tinted the chancellor’s veins.

*There aren’t signs of struggle, so suicide is possible. But look at her, she looks terrified. Why would she be scared, if she decided to do this herself?*

Something wasn’t right.

“How long has she been dead?”

Boch checked the dataslate again. “Hard to tell, with all the juvs, but… about three days, apparently.”

*Huh. That’s interesting. It’s around the time we came back from Constanza’s.*

“And how come nobody has missed her since then?”

Boch shrugged “That’s above my paygrade. My guess is that everybody is so busy preparing for the Rites that they just… forgot.”

“This is not something that Markov would just forget” Erika muttered to herself.

“What’s that?”

“Nothing” She didn’t want to give Boch anything more than she needed to. He looked lazy, but he was still paid by the Corporation. "One question, Boch. Why am I here?"

“Huh?” The chief seemed confused “There’s a dead chancellor.”

“Yes, I see that. But why am *I* here? Couldn’t you deal with this on your own?”

“Oh, that. Boss told me to call you, specifically. Something about how you have an… what did he call it… instinct, for these things. Look, Belcroft, I don’t ask questions. The boss tells me to do something, I do it. That’s how I keep my job.”

So it wasn’t a suicide after all. Or, at least, Markov suspected it wasn’t. In fact, Erika was fairly sure that he suspected another chancellor, or maybe another high-ranking member of the Corporation. That’s why he’d called her, the only person he could be sure wasn’t in someone else’s pocket.

*So, we’re back to the original question*, Erika thought. *What scares a person to death?*

“Mamzel Belcroft! What an exquisite surprise, seeing you here.” A familiar voice exclaimed from the the other side of the room. It made Erika’s bones chill.

“Inspector,” She answered, turning to face the petite figure. Behind him, Enforcer Minsk was guarding the door. “I thought you were working the Faustus case.”

“And I thought you were visiting your father! I guess we’re all full of surprises, are we not? How is he, by the way? Has he chosen an attire for the Rites yet? I do hope he’s able to attend.”

“He’s well, thank you.” Erika flinched involuntarily as she said that. And he caught it. _Fuck_.

“Speaking of the Faustus case.” He continued. “Here’s an interesting development. Cross-checking the records of people we have detained with similar symptoms, we arrived at a very interesting conclusion.” The inspector started pacing up and down the room “See, we think that there is a common source for all of… well, all of this mess.” He paused, and inspected Erika’s face.

*He’s looking for a reaction, he suspects something* “Oh, really?” She knew that she couldn’t fake being surprised, so she went for disinterested instead, and went back to examining the cadaver.

“Yes, really!” The inspector said with a big smile. “In fact, we tracked one of our suspects, and that confirmed our suspicions. It’s the PleaseCogs, you see. Every person that we arrested was a frequent patron at one of those places.”

“Fascinating” Erika tried to sound as flat as possible.

“I must admit, I thought you would be more enthused about this development. Particularly given the… fervor with which your father frequents those places. I don’t suppose he would know anything about this whole thing, would he?”

That was more than a suggestion. It was an overt threat. Erika looked at the short man, trying to decipher him.

He just stood there, smiling.

“No, I don’t think he does” She said, finally. Trygon looked sincerely dissapointed.

“A pity, really. Such potential…” He added, his eyes piercing Erika's. “Well, I would appreciate your efforts if you could ask him again, mamzel Belcroft. If he happens to remember something, please call me directly. I know it doesn’t seem like it, but we, servants of the Empire, *are* all on the same side. We should help each other in bringing whoever did this to justice.”

“I will ask, Inspector.” Erika answered.

“Thank you kindly, mamzel. Remember, the Empire doesn’t forget the people who given them services… or people who refuse to.”

This last threat hung in the silent air for a while. Erika knew that everyone in the room was looking at them, and they seemed to have forgotten the dead Chancellor. Inspectors tended to have that effect.

Trygon's face didn't move an inch. He bathed in the silence, letting the tension in the room be felt by everyone.

Finally, he spoke.

“Well, that was a nice chat! Thank you mamzel Belcroft. Now, please leave the room.”

As if waking up from a spell, everyone sprang into action.

“What?” Erika asked.

“Yes, of course. And all your friends from the Corporation as well, if you please.”

“Now, wait a minute,” Boch started saying. “This is one of Sagitar’s Chancellors. It’s Corporation business, you have nothing to do here.”

“Oh, but that isn’t the case at all, my dear security chief. Agent Minsk, please show him the warrant.” She handed a dataslate to the chief, who started reading it. “As you can see, this is now in the Empire’s jursidiction. More precisely, *my* jurisdiction. Your assistance is no longer required.”

“On what grounds?” Erika asked. She was surprised Nabokov had given it up.

“Well, this is an event that could gravely affect the Data Entry Rites. Given the recent… turmoil, and the closeness of the date, the Empire didn’t think it wise to leave it to the Corporation. Hence, I’m here.”

Boch finished reading the dataslate. He shrugged and nodded to Erika.

“Fantastic! Now that we all understand each other, please leave us to our work.”

Erika let out a silent curse when the door closed behind them.

---

“Shh!” Rien told Tristan, at the top of the stairs. The cat was purring, and rubbing his head against Rien’s thigh.

While the floor downstairs was mostly living space, this floor seemed destined to more practical matters. It was a single, big, oval room, with transparent walls.

Rien tried to hear what was happening downstairs. When all those Enforcers had shown up, they had ran up the stairs, hiding. He didn’t hear any steps above them in the top floor, and finally relaxed a bit. He knelt, and pet Tristan on the head, returning his affection.

“You’re going to get us caught sometime.” He said, feigning anger. The cat looked at him, and didn’t seem to care at all. “Well, we’re here now. Might as well look around.”

Below, he could hear Erika arguing with someone. Rien couldn’t understand what they were saying, but Erika didn’t seem happy. He remembered why they were here. Erika thought that the death of a Chancellor, this close to the Rites, couldn’t be a coincidence. She had asked him to explore the house, and find out what he could, while she dealt with the people from the Corporation.

Rien was grateful for the new opportunity. This time, he would stick to the plan. He looked around the room.

They started exploring the upper floor of the house. The house wasn’t that much bigger than Belcroft manor, but even Rien could see the stark difference in class between them. He was impressed by Erika’s house, but this one was even more ostentatious in every way.

The first difference were the transparent walls. The house was built at the top of the Spire, high above anything else in Decorat. From Erika’s house, Rien could see the roofs of other great houses, and even the Archive. From here, Rien felt like he could see the entire city. Looking out, Rien could see the beautiful gardens of the upper classes. He could see the Archive, with its gothic towers reaching upwards, like a bed of spikes. Beyond the archive, he saw the vast sea of plascrete towers that formed the Grids, made translucent by the thick layer of smog. Ever further, in the outer limits of Decorat, was the starport, surrounded by ships of all shapes and sizes. From this distance, Rien thought that it looked like rotting food that was swarming with insects. This notion, combined with the height, made him a little dizzy.

The inside of the room was also impressive. The staircase leading downstairs divided the gigantic room in two halves.

On one half, there was a big wooden desk, with a single, high-backed chair. There was a screen etched into the wood, and the desk was engraved with shiny trails of light that zig-zagged from the screen to the floor, forming a net of pulsating light. Rien imagined those would be datalinks, but he had never seen such a big network before.

On the other half, there were two things that caught Rien’s attention. One was a heating stove, with wood burning inside. _Real wood_. Rien couldn’t imagine the amount of money somebody must have to be *burning* wood*.* The other was a Congnitor. Rien saw that some of the datalinks went from the desk into the Cognitor’s chair. Driven by curiosity, he tapped the screen on the desk.

“Huh, this is weird” He told Tristan, who had decided to curl beside the fire. “It's unlocked.” The cat didn’t seem to find it as interesting as the stove.

Rien’s heart stopped for a second when his earpiece crackled.

“Rien, where are you?” It was Erika. She wasn’t happy.

“I’m upstairs.” He answered “What’s going on?”

“You don’t want to know. Come down, we’re leaving.”

“There’s something weird here, miss Belcroft. I think you should see this.”

There was a pause on the other end. Eventually, Erika answered.

“Okay. Stay where you are, I’m coming.”

---

“You were right, boy” Erika said, looking at the screen.

“Maybe she didn’t think anyone could come into the house?” Rien wondered.

“I don’t buy that. These systems have access to the entire infrastructure of Sagitar in Decorat. They are too precious to be left open like this. No, this is something else…”

She had a hunch. Erika typed some commands in the terminal, and the logs of the Cognitor appeared before her. Just like she suspected.

“Here. See these entries? This Cognitor was used right before the time of death. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”

She remembered the Chancellor’s face of terror.

Erika muttered under her breath. "Let’s see what scared you, Chancellor Atsuki."

She pressed some more glyphs, and a message appeared before her.

It was the last memory that was accessed in that Cognitor, encrypted. According to the records, it had been inserted into the Congnitor’s private databanks a few hours before the date of death. Erika queried the memory’s signature, but it didn’t correspond to any known record.

Still, she knew that this memory was the real weapon of Dana’s murder. Somebody had inserted this data into Atsuki’s Cognitor. Whatever was inside of this memory was bad enough to drive the Chancellor mad.

It was too much of a coincidence. It *had* to be connected to Kyriel, somehow.

The thought of that worried her. If she was right -- and she strongly suspected she was -- Markov believed that a high-ranking Sagitar officer had killed Dana. If that was true, that same person was likely behind the sickness spreading from the PleaseCogs.

She saved a copy of that memory’s signature. At least, it was another piece of the puzzle. But she had to hurry in solving it. Dana’s murder was clearly an escalation. With it, the people responsible had shown they far they were willing to go. And, if Markov’s suspicions proved right, Erika feared that they could actually go the distance.

# Crumbs

“I’m almost at the chancellor’s house” Erika heard Rien’s voice on the other side of the commlink.

“Good. Be careful, Rien. Just get the drone in, and then *stand by.* You hear me?” The boy had come a long way since Constanza’s, but not nearly long enough to make Erika comfortable.

“Right, right…”

“Hey. It’s not like I have a better job, right?”

A chuckle came from the other end “Yeah, that’s true. Be careful, miss Belcroft. These people are dangerous”

The commlink stopped crackling.

Erika focused on her own task. The big wooden doors of the council room were always a sight to behold. Erika examined them closer. Had they somehow changed the ethchings? It must have been a trick of the light, there is no way they replaced the door in such a short time. _Focus, Belcroft_. She wasn’t here to admire woodwork. She was here as a distraction.

Without hesitation, she pushed the doors open, and barged in.

“… And why would you think that, Lobos? You have as much style as a hab-block.” Chancellor Zhu Li was reprimanding Lobos for something. Looking at her, Erika could have sworn she hadn’t moved an inch since the last meeting, weeks ago.

"Oh, give me a break! You want to make the flags red! *Imperial* Red! Are you out of your mind, Zhu Li? Markov, back me up here, please." Lobos had definitely moved since the last meeting.

“We have to present an image of unity, Lobos. Imperial red is the best choice for this year’s flags.”

When Erika arrived before them, she clanked her heels on the ground, snapping into a martial salute. That seemed to get their attention.

“And what do *you* want?” Lobos barked. “Don’t you see we’re in the middle of a meeting?”

“Now, now, Simon, no need to be so cross with mamzel Belcroft.” As usual, Markov was the calming presence of the bunch. “Erika is here with my permission. Apparently, she has something to say about poor Dana’s departure.”

“What’s there to say? She finally got one century too many, and got bored. Great timing, too! Now we’re stuck with her load of work for the Rites, like the fucking flag color.”

Erika cleared her throat. “Actually, Chancellor Lobos, I don’t think that’s quite accurate.”

He looked at her, inquisitively. Then, Erika’s earpiece crackled again. It was Rien.

“I’m at the house, miss Belcroft. Going in.” *Great,* she thought *now, I just have to distract them for a few more moments…*

“Well?” Asked Lobos. “Don’t just stand there, tell us!”

Erika returned his gaze, defiant.

“I believe Dana Atsuki was murdered.”

Erika was expecting surprise, maybe anger, but not what came next.

“So *what?* She’s dead, right? She lived a full life, or whatever. Several, actually. We all have enemies in Decorat. How does that help us here?”

The other chancellors seemed just as unphased as Lobos.

*I’ll have to do something heavier, then*. It was a gamble. So far, she had already told Markov everything she was going to do, but this would be going off-script.

“That’s not all, Chancellor Lobos. I believe she was murdered by someone in this room.”

*That did it.* The chancellors looked at each other with a mixture of suspicion, alarm and fear. Except Markov. Chief System Officer Markov was looking at Erika, and he didn’t look pleased.

“Now, now, miss Belcroft. We can’t jump into conclusions like that, can we?” His tone clearly conveyed *at least not here.*

“That’s preposterous!” Zhu Li snapped. “Why would any of us want poor Dana dead?”

“I have strong reasons to believe that one of you did.” Erika continued. She wondered what Rien was doing, why he hadn’t contacted her yet. “Her Cognitor had been interfered with, a memory implanted. You’re some of the few people with the means to do something like that.”

Lobos turned to the CSO

“Markov, please get her out of here. She clearly doesn’t know what she’s saying. You don’t believe a word of this, do you?”

Markov wasn’t looking at him. His eyes were fixated on Erika, and they weren’t happy.

“I don’t, dear Lobos. At least, not for now. She has some explaining to do. Mamzel Belcroft, do you have any evidence to support your claims?” His eyes clearly said *you better have, if you want this to end well for you.*

A beeping commslink broke resonated on the marble walls of the massive chamber, Chancellor Zhu Li started speaking into her own device, and everyone turned to her.

“Uh-huh. Intruders? Yes. Well, terminate them, of course!" She paused briefly "And John? Do your job. Don’t call me again for this!” She turned to the gathering. “Sorry about that. My men found someone breaking into my house, and those incompetents didn’t know what to do with them.”

Every muscle in Erika's face burned with tension, as she tried to keep her impassible expression. *Rien…* She still had to keep this up for a bit.

“I don’t have evidence yet, Chief Markov. But, if you would allow me to access the signatures of the Chancellors, we might find one that matches the killer memory.”

“I’m afraid that’s not going to be possible. Those signatures are too sensitive to expose, _especisally_ without proof. I have to admit, I’m somewhat dissappointed in you, mamzel Belcroft, making inane accusations like those. Please leave this meeting at once. Come back with proof, or don’t come back at all.”

“Yes, sir” Was all Erika could say to that.

Her boots clinked on the marble floor, punctuating the silence that accompanied her as she left.

---

The cold rain was new for Rien. Sure, it rained down in the Grid, but by the time the water reached the hab blocks it had already gone through layers and layers of thick smog, which turned it into a sort of warm, oily stew.

“I’m almost at the chancellor’s house” Rien said through his commlink.

“Good. Be careful, Rien. Just get the drone in, and then *stand by.* You hear me?” Erika’s voice crackled over the link. She was on the other side, distracting the chancellors while Rien snuck into one of their houses.

“Right, right…” He answered. Part of him liked having someone who worried about him, but he still felt bad that Erika didn’t trust him more.

“Hey. It’s not like I have a better job, right?”

Rien chuckled “Yeah, that’s true. Be careful, miss Belcroft. These people are dangerous.”

Tristan, by his side, chirped.

“Yes, I know. She just wants me to be okay.” Rien said, kneeling to pet Tristan’s furry back “I just… nevermind” It was hard to put into words.

They continued walking towards the house. Apparently, this chancellor didn’t like to live in the Spires, and instead was happy with a more “modest” — that’s the word Erika had used — house, down the street from Belcroft Manor. Of course, “modest” was on the eye of the beholder.

Chancellor Zhu Li’s house was the biggest in the neighborhood. It was located at the end of the street. A gated cul-de-sac gave way to a giant five-story palace. Even from outside, Rien could see the wooden walls that covered its facade. The windows were made of paper, the backlight revealing the silhouette of the people inside, doing all manner of chores. The roofs were curved upwards at the edges, giving the falling rain some momentum to form sparkling clear waterfalls. A series of concealed mini-gravitons altered the fall speed of the liquid, making it splosh in an intricate, almost musical pattern.

He located the his target — A small window on the east corner of the second floor. Luckily, the lights were off in the room, but he still didn’t know how he was going to get there.

*Step one is to get closer*, he thought. *And for that, we have to get over that fence.*

The fence was composed of steel bars, twice as tall as an adult, culminating in what looked like sharp spearheads. They were separated enough for Tristan to get through, but not for Rien.

*Think, Rien. What would Luci do here?* He could almost hear the old man’s voice.

“Every wall has a weak spot, boy. See, most people focus on two things — guarding the front, and guarding the back. But nobody can defend the whole thing. If you look closely, you’ll find the weakness. Then it’s just a matter of applying the right leverage.”

Rien started walking around the fence, looking for weak spots. It didn’t take him long to find one. It was a perfect tunnel, hidden in some bushes, wide enough to fit someone much bigger than him.

“That’s strange” Rien told Tristan. “This should be full of water. _The water hasn’t had time to pool yet, which means that it was dug just minutes ago”_

Rien felt a shiver. Was somebody else trying to do the same thing as he? Still, he had to pull forward. Miss Belcroft thought that the chancellor’s house could be a key to solving this, so he had to do his part.

“I’m at the house, miss Belcroft.” He said into his commlink. “Going in.” Rien could hear other people arguing on the other side. *Probably the chancellors.* He was very glad to be where he was, and not in that room.

He tapped a screen mounted in his wrist. The drone came to life, showing him data from its scans.

*Huh, that’s weird. The electronic bodymass detectors at the house seem to be offline.* With those out of combat, the guards had to rely on visual identification to detect intruders. And with Tristan’s sight, they could easily avoid that.

He took a deep breath. He was going to do it right this time. He wouldn’t fail Miss Belcroft — or Cel — again.

He slipped through the wet earth of the tunnel, towards the house.

---

Through careful navigation, they had avoided the patrols that guarded the gardens of the house. So far, things were going well. Rien was below the window with the target, wondering how he would get up there. The way he saw it, there were two choices. He could go into the house, and try to navigate it from there, or he could try to climb the wall. Neither of them seemed particularly appealing, or feasible for that matter.

He cursed under his breath. He should have thought of this before going under the fence! Now he was stuck here, and it was only a matter of time before the guards found him. Going into the house sounded like suicide, and he couldn’t climb the smooth, wooden wall. He had failed.

Unless… An idea struck him. *He* didn’t have to climb the wall at all! He only had to get the drone there! He looked down at Tristan, and smiled. The cat stopped scratching behind his ear and looked at him, puzzled.

“Want to go for a climb?” Rien said.

Tristan only chirped in response.

---

Tristan’s mechanical legs whirred loudly as he jumped. When he reached the wall, his metal claws latched onto the wall with a thud. With the drone in his mouth, the cat made his way up the wall, while Rien waited below.

“That’s it…” Rien said under his breath, looking up “just a little bit more…”. He heard footsteps behind him. His heart skipped a beat, but Rien had enough presence of mind left to dive into a nearby bush.

He put his belly to the floor, trying to breathe as lightly as possible. He saw three pairs of boots pass by, striking the floor in unison. One of them stepped on mud, and some of it splashed Rien in the face. If he hadn’t covered his mouth, he would be tasting wet mud now.

After a while, the boots passed by. Rien lay there, heart beating, mud in his face, for a while more, too scared to move. He hoped Tristan had been able to hide. Given that the guards have passed by, that was likely the case.

He felt something rubbing against his left leg, and he almost yelped with surprise. It was Tristan. The cat was laying there, looking at him, intrigued.

Rien couldn’t help but smile. He looked at the window, and saw that the cat had torn through the paper. The console on his wrist told him that the drone was inside the room.

“Well done, Tristan.” He whispered. He had never had a pet, but he realized that he liked this cat very much.

*Time to do what we’re here to do* he thought, and he focused on his terminal. From the drone scans, Rien could see that this house was very different from Chancellor Dana’s. It wasn’t just the windows that were made of paper. The walls, the lamps, and a lot of the decorations were also made from thin colored sheets of paper. The rest of the room was comprised of a polished darkwood floor, a single wooden stool, and … *gotcha* he thought, as he saw the Cognitor interface hanging from the backrest of the chair.

This was their goal. He navigated the drone up to the Congitor’s console, and plugged into it. Unlike Dana’s this one was encrypted.

Rien cursed under his breath. Of course it was!

Everything wasn’t lost, though. He would copy the encrypted data, and try to deal with that later. He pressed some glyphs on his screen. The drone connected to the Cognitor and started transmitting data back to the Belcroft basement.

Now, they only had to wait.

---

There was not a lot Rien could do while they waited. He was keeping an eye on the drone screen, and an ear on the ground, listening for incoming guards.

Something came up on the screen. Someone had entered the room. Rien switched to camera mode, and he saw a male figure in a black bodysuit. The skin-tight rubber outfit showed a bulky and muscular physique, similar to one of those stimm-packed mules that Constanza used for protection. This one, however, was different. He moved a lot quicker, with precision. Rien was fairly sure that this was the person that had dug he tunnel.

Rien saw the man look directly into the drone’s lense, and he felt his blood chill. He had the same white eyes and blank expression as Jordan Belcroft when he tried to kill Rien. The man swatted a mighty backand at the drone, disconnecting it from the Cognitor and sending it flying across the room. It crashed against the wall in a shower of sparks and scrap metal, and the drone fell to the ground. Rien tried to lift it up, but the controls weren’t working. The propellers took splinters off of the wall and floor, as the drone battled to take flight again. The man hit it again, knocking it down. *Damn! Probably a busted propulsor.*

He hoped that the drone had time to transfer the data. For now, he could only lay there, helplessly looking through the tiny screen, seeing how the man approached the Congitor and connected something to it.

Immediately after, though, something in Rien’s screen flashed red. The drone’s scanners had picked up a lot of movement, heading towards the room. He could also hear boots running towards his position. The drone’s noises had probably alerted the guards. They probably didn’t know he was there, they were probably looking for the man. He may have time to escape, but he had to do it now.

But that would mean leaving the drone. *Damn!* He started to get up _I can't just leave it her! I've worked so hard on it._. Then he stopped in his tracks. *No. Not this time.* He took a deep breath. They could get out of here, safely, and report back to Erika. He wasn’t going to charge into danger without thinking. Not again.

He sighed, and pressed a few buttons on his wrist mount. Above, in the room, a single explosion set one of the windows on fire. Afetr a long second of silence, the entire house burst into motion. He signalled Tristan to move, and they started making their way back to the tunnel.

They were halfway through when they heard the first gunshots. When they reached the other side of the fence, he heard Erika’s voice

“Rien! Rien, come in!”

“Yes, I’m here. We’re out of the chancellor’s house, making our way home.”

“Good. I heard the Chancellor’s guards caught someone sneaking, and I thought the worst.”

“We’re okay. But I didn’t have time to copy all the data. This man showed up, and —”

“That’s okay. Wait for me at home, we’ll talk more then.”

# Chase

Erika arrived at the mansion a few minutes later. As soon as the door to her flier opened, she darted in.

“Welcome back, mamzel. How did it go?” Olin greeted her at the door.

“It went okay.” Erika answered, barely slowing down to hand him her coat. “I need to speak with Rien. Where is he?”

“In the basement as usual, mamzel.”

Erika stormed down the stairs. Rien was working on something on his wrist when she arrived. Tristan was sleeping placidly beside him.

“Are you okay? What happened there?” Erika realized her tone sounded a little more worried than she wanted -- or, really, expected -- it to.

Rien turned. He was beaming, which was absolutely not what she would have guessed.

“It was great! I almost went back for the drone, but I remembered what you said, and I did the smart thing!”

“Wait, slow down. What do you mean? Did you leave the drone?”

“No, I blew it up! I think the house will be fine, though, it was raining a lot.”

“I noticed. Look, you’re going to have to tell me everything from the beginning”

Rien told her how he snuck in under the fence, how Tristan dropped the droid into the room, and how they almost got caught.

“I couldn’t get all the data, though. This man with the blank eyes appeared, and busted the droid! Still, I got a good chunk out. From the size, last hundred accesses or so.”

“Slow down, Rien. What man?”

“Oh, right! There was this man. Huge, like Igor. But faster, like you! He was in the room also, I think he was the one who dug the tunnel. He had the same stare as Mr Belcroft when… you know.” He briefly paused for a breath.

Erika nodded “Go on.”

“He busted the droid, like really busted. I think that’s what called the guards on him. But before the guards came, he was doing something on the Cognitor. I couldn’t see what, though. Sorry”

“That’s okay. This is good information. Try to decrypt the data we have, will you?”

“Sure thing!” He seemed positively giddy about it. He turned back on his chair, and started typing furiously in a terminal.

Erika thought for a bit. If this man was under the same influence as her father, that was really bad news. It meant that Kyriel, or whoever was doing this, had very fine control over their victims. To sneak into a Chancellor’s house was hard enough. To do it through someone else’s body, was another thing entirely. And much more worrying.

Erika’s implant flashed a notification. Boch was calling. She responded, projecting the chief’s image onto the basement floor.

“Yes?”

“I don’t know what you’ve said to the bosses, Belcroft, but Markov is pissed.”

Erika wasn’t surprised.

“Did you call me just to tell me off?”

“Ha. Funny. Listen, I got my hands full right now. In case you don’t remember, a Chancellor is dead, and someone has been caught sneaking into another one’s house. And you crying murder in a *council meeting* doesn’t help either.”

“So you do know what I told the bosses” Erika couldn’t resist poking him a little bit.

Boch wasn’t amused “Of course I know. Shut up and listen, Belcroft. The boss says that the Rites are coming, and you better solve this quick. Otherwise… well, you know. Or not. I don’t care.”

“Thank you, Boch, that is a tremendous help”

“Woke up with the funny foot, now have we? I’m almost tempted to not give you this. But it’s my ass on the line too if this doesn’t get solved pronto, so here you go. We ran the memory you found in Chancellor Dana’s Cognitor through the Archive registry. The signature doesn’t match any of the official providers.”

“Which means…”

“It means it's not ours. It wasn’t created in any official Cognitors, and it wasn’t recorded during the Rites. Most likely contraband.”

“I’m surprised, Boch.” Erika said, with a big smile “That *was* indeed useful!” This was payback from the messup with the clearance, and she was enjoying it.

“Again, very funny. Get it done.” And he hung up.

Erika enjoyed a good-hearted laugh. She had needed that for a while. When she calmed down, she saw Rien staring at her with eyes like starships.

“What?” She asked.

“That was a security officer from the Corporation.” Rien said, once he managed to close his mouth.

“Yes, so?”

“How can you talk to him like that?”

Erika stopped to think. “I don’t really know. I guess I couldn’t help it.”

“You’re not afraid that he will come for you?”

“No, not really. We don’t always see eye to eye, but eventually we both want the same thing, and answer to the same person. There’s no reason for him to come after me, it would probably cost him too much.”

“Still, I would be scared. I don’t know if that’s brave or stupid, miss Belcroft.”

Erika thought about it for a while, and then started laughing again.

“What’s so funny?” Rien asked, blushing.

“I just realized why Olin likes you so much, Rien. Yes, you two have the same background, but you have the same recklessness I had as a child. Took him more than a few headaches to rein me it, but he must have enojyed it! Now he’s doing the same with you.”

Rien sat there for a while, dumfounded. Then, he joined Erika in her laughter.

Olin walked down the stairs. “What’s going on?”

Erika and Rien looked at each other, and just laughed harder.

“Nothing, dear Olin. We were just appreciating you” Erika said, when they stopped. Olin was clearly annoyed, but he didn't say a word.

“I heard chief Boch calling. What did he want?”

They had stopped laughing at this point.

“He had very useful information. According to Boch, the memory we found at Chancellor Dana’s house is not official. That means that it probably came from a PleaseCog donation. Rien, do you have access to Constanza’s memory donation history?”

Rien wrote some commands in the terminal.

“No, not really. It looks like the records for donations are erased once the data is in the machines themselves. It can only be accessed by connecting directly to the Cognitor.”

"Well, it looks like we’ll have to hit all the damn PleaseCogs and bars in the Grid. That should be just under twenty thousand." It was technically an exaggeration, but only by a very thing margin "Better start now."

“Not necessarily” Rien said. He typed some more, and a list appeared on the screen. “Remember that list of affected people? I matched the list with the list of customers in each of Constanza’s bars, and I found only two that all of these people have visited — *The* *TruJoi* and *Dreamers.* They are both in Pleasure Level 150.”

"I’m familiar with *The TruJoi*" Erika said. She still remembered the ambush quite vividly. "Let’s pay them another visit. Well done, Rien."

---

*Lovely as ever,* thought Erika when she breathed the smog of the Grid. At daytime, the bridges of Pleasure Level 150 were empty and quiet. However, that didn’t stop an adzep from blasting out of its speakers.

"*Fellow Decoratians! Rejoice! The Rites are here! Don’t forget to buy your pass! Tomorrow, we celebrate! Tomorrow, we feast! The Sagitar Corporation welcomes you all!"*

They walked through the thick courtains of *The TruJoi*, and they were greeted by the familiar purple glow.

“Welcome back, mamzel! Here to rub my face against the counter again? I’m afraid we’re closed now, you’ll have to come back later for that.” Well, there was the purple glow… and that clerk. Erika wasn’t looking forward to this.

“Listen, I’m sorry about what happened before, okay?” Erika felt Rien’s confused look. “Let’s forget about it. I want to be in good terms.”

“Of course, mamzel.” Erika suspected that Constanza had something to do with that quick acceptance.

The clerk looked at Rien, confused. “I’m sorry, mamzel, but are you sure you’d like to bring the young one with you? These can be… extreme places”

“Thank you, but yes. This boy has seen things worse than anything we can find down there.”

“Very well.” The clerk waved a hand over the table, and the holograms appeared “What will it be today?”

Rien saw the holograms, and his cheeks caught fire. He tried to avert his gaze out of decency, but he failed miserably. His curiosity got the better of him. *Maybe I should have warned him,* Erika thought. *Oh well. The boy has seen worse.*

*"*We’re actually not looking for that today."

“You sure come to PleaseCog bars often, for someone who is never interested in the goods. Oh well, what a pity. Maybe next time, I’ll get to know your… tastes”

It was Erika’s turn to blush now, although she was able to hide it better than Rien. “We’ll see.” She managed to answer.

She cleared her throat, and continued.

“We’re actually here on a case. Constanza has ensured us that you’re trustworthy.”

“I’m flattered that he would think so highly of me. Yes, I know of the case.” He said, calmly. “I’ve been instructed to be of every assistance. What can I help you with?”

*So you’ve just been messing with us for fun.* Erika thought.

“We have reason to suspect that this bar is one of the sources of the illness, and that the illness originates from a PleaseCog memory. We’d like to examine your PleaseCogs databanks, to see if we find out any information about the memory.”

“Of course! Please, follow me” The clerk waved over the counter again, and the holograms turned into a projected keyboard with strange glyphs. He pressed a combination of them, and a door behind him opened. A few more keypresses, and the black curtains that usually welcomed visitors turned solid, blocking the exit. “Nobody will bother us now”, the clerk added with a smile.

Erika didn’t like this at all. It looked like another trap. Constanza’s word was the only thing stopping her from reaching to her gun. But, so far, Constanza had been a good ally.

The room behind the counter was small and cramped. Most of the space was taken up by the humming databank, the size of a big wardrobe. Mechanical cogs whirred inside it, and blinking lights displayed a myriad of status reports. Unlike in Chancellor Dana’s house, the datalinks connecting the bank with the access terminal were hanging from the ceiling.

“This is an electric fire waiting to happen!” Rien exclaimed. He seemed almost… offended by the hanging wires.

“Well, our customers don’t really care about that, boy.” The butler responded, equally bothered by Rien. “There’s the console, get to work.”

Rien scoffed, and he mumbled something about them caring when their heads are on fire while he walked to the terminal. He connected his wrist-screen to it, and started pressing buttons.

“Where do these memories usually come from?” Erika asked while Rien worked.

“Well, many places. Some are dreams, some are people wanting to forget something. Some are even gifted by the Corporation! But most of them, we buy from people who need money. They lose that particular, usually happy memory in the extraction, but they usually prefer the cash.”

“I see. And can anyone donate their memories?”

“Yes, generally. As long as the content is good, we don’t ask too many questions about where it came from.”

“Do you keep a log of donors?”

“We do, but most donors prefer anonimity. You see, some of these memories are not necessarily things one is… proud of. We take great value in our discretion.”

“Speaking of content, who vets these memories? Does anyone see them before they get added to the databank?”

“Ah, yes. We have a few testers that see all the memories. A few have been sick lately, but nothing out of the ordinary.”

“It’s here!” Rien exclaimed, without turning. Erika and the clerk huddled around the screen. “Here, see? This memory, it has the same signature as the other one. Donor is anonymous, though.”

“Well done, Rien” Erika said. She turned to the clerk. “Who was the tester for this memory?”

“Let me look at the date…” The clerk pressed a finger to his temple, and pressed down. Erika and Rien hadn’t realized it, but a tiny metal wheel was sticking out of his forehead. The clerk scrolled down, looking at the ceiling. “Yes… here. Remus Cilindro. Huh, strange. He called in sick a few days ago, and he hasn’t returned since.”

Erika and Rien looked at each other.

“We’re going to need this man’s address” Erika said.

Remus Cilindro’s hab was no different than the thousands that covered the facade of the Grids. At least, on the outside. Even before knocking in the door, they could sense the sweet smell of rot slipping from under the door.

Erika knocked the door. She wasn’t expecting an answer, but she had to try at least. When nobody did, she nodded to Rien, and the boy unlocked the door with a frightening ease.

The air inside was rancid, filled with the stench of stale food and rotting clothes.

Erika turned the light on. The single, bare lightbulb blinked twice before turning on. The bugs that covered the floor scrambled away, looking for darker corners. Flies buzzed around a sink full of dirty dishes, and black liquid was dripping from the small refrigerating unit.

Remus Cilindro, or at least what was left of him, was sprawled on the floor. He was clutching a short-barrel stubber in his right hand, which at some point he had obviously pointed to his temple. Behind him, the wall was a grim painting of dark, dry blood.

“We’re too late” Rien said, covering his mouth.

Erika didn’t answer, but instead paced around the body. Yes, the man was dead already. But there was something strange in this one. This is not the way Kyriel usually disposed of people.

“Why is he dead?” Erika wondered out loud.

“Well, I think he shot himself” Rien answered, giving Erika a confused look.

“I know, that’s not what I mean. I mean, why would Kyriel want this one dead? All their other victims have been alive so far. Mad, but alive. They want to *control* people, not kill them. Why would this one be any different?”

Something caught Erika’s eye. The man was holding something in his left hand.

“Help me out” She asked Rien.

Together, they pushed the body sideways. It fell to the ground with a low thud. Erika knelt, and took a better look at his hand. It was a dataslate. The screen was crusty with dried blood and ichor, but it was still functional.

“It’s a diary” Erika said, and started reading out loud. “*Another day, another pay. Today it’s been all vanilla memories, like usual. We’ve had no imports lately, either. Do people not do fun stuff anymore?*”

“Do we have to do this here?” Rien said, still covering his nose and mouth. “It stinks”

“Right.” Erika had to agree “Let’s take this back to the mansion.”

---

Kyriel wasn’t happy, the figure could feel it.

“She’s getting too close!” The snarl of their voice made her skin crawl. “She and that *boy* got our peon captured! We were lucky we could break him before they could get to him. We need to kill her, now!”

It took everything she had to answer “No!”

“No?” Kyriel’s voice boomed in her head, making her ears hurt “NO?”

“I won’t, Kyriel. We won’t outright kill people” She managed to say.

“You fool! One more, what difference, does it make?” Kyriel’s wet words slithered through her mind, permeating every thought with a thick layer of mucus. “Dana is dead. You killed her, and you know it!”

They both felt the guilt coursing through the host’s mind “It wasn’t like that!” The agony and doubt in her words was palpable. “I just wanted to show her… to show all of them, the Chancellors… so that they would understand!”

“And look where that got her!” If she had any clarity of mind, she would have detected glee behind the ire of Kyriel’s words. That *thing* was enjoying this. “She’s dead! And so is Jordan Belfort! And you have the gall to say you won’t kill. Your hands stopped being clean a long time ago.”

The figure crutched to their knees, and started sobbing lightly. “I-I didn’t… It wasn’t me… those were accidents… just that!”

“That’s not true and you know it! They *had* to die, and we killed them. *You,* killed them.”

“No!” The sobbing turned into a painful scream. She shouted and shouted, trying to get the wet, slimy being out of her head. “Go away! Go! AWAY!”

Then, silence. For a few blissful moments, her head was clear again. Slowly, dubitatively, she rose to her feet.

When Kyriel’s voice came back, it wasn’t the same hard tone as before. It was soft and sticky, like warm honey.

“Remember why we’re doing this.” As Kyriel spoke, images filled her mind. Visions of peace, prosperity, equality and justice, for everyone. “We are so close.”

The figure stood there, marvelling at the visions. They were close, their plans were about to come to fruition. Regardless of their hiccups, the experiments had been a success. Just a few more days, and they would be ready for the final move. “We *are*, Kyriel”

“There you go…” Kyriel’s voice cradled her mind, making her feel at peace “Look, out there”

Guided by Kyriel, she looked out of the window. She could see the people, going about their daily, miserable lives. They had the power to change that.

“We can’t give up now, can we?” Kyriel asked, though they already knew what she would answer.

“No… we can’t.” For the good of humanity, she couldn’t stop now. She felt a warm calm overcome her. “You’re right, Kyriel. We can’t stop now. A few people are insignificant for the greater good.”

Inside her head, Kyriel smiled.

Sitting in the armchair with Tristan napping on her lap, Erika was reading the diary.

“*No fun today either. These ninkers keep bringing shit picts, them doing it with their partners, or having a really good meal, or something"* The diary said.”*Even the group stuff is no fun anymore. I’m bored."*

Erika kept reading. The entries continued like that for a while. Apparently, this man had been doing the same thing for so long that everything seemed mundane.

Eventually, she arrived at an interesting one.

"*Today, something interesting happened. Finally. A woman came into the shop, to make a donation. She was covered in some old plas-leather cape or something, but I could see she was nervous. She kept looking around, like she was seeing something. Made my skin crawl. But hey, it was something different."*

This looked promising. Erika kept reading.

"*Extraction went well. Very well, actually. The woman looked like she knew her way around a Cognitor. I was swamped today, so I told her that I would test it tomorrow. She didn’t seem to care much. She left in a hurry, I don’t think this piece was legit. I can’t wait for tomorrow. Stolen memories are always juicy."*

Erika kept reading.

"*What the hell. That was the most trippy memory I’ve ever seen. There was this voice, and all these people were chanting the name Kyriel, and then they started fighting each other! Man, there was so much blood. I had a blast, but I don’t think anyone will be interested in it."*

Then he reverted back to being bored for several more entries. Eventually, Erika found the next piece.

"*I keep having these dreams. It’s like a voice is inside my head, and is trying to tell me something. I tell it no, but it just keeps coming. Says the name is Kyriel, and that they will allow me to see and understand. That’s messed up, I guess that memory hit me harder than I thought. Hope they go away soon, I don’t really want do to a reset now."*

The next entry wasn’t until a few days later.

"*Fuck. I can’t sleep anymore! I just need it to go away, just for a bit… Fuck!"*

And then a couple of days later.

"*That ninker woman showed up today something about checking progress. Whatever. She did this. I can’t fucking sleep, I can’t do my job. I confronted her when she was leaving. She was freaking strong for someone so small, I ended up on the floor. But I got a peek under that cape. I saw red velvet. That ninker was from the Archive. I’ve got you now. I’m going to find you, and I’m going to kill you for doing this to me."*

Erika put the diary down for a second. Someone from the Archive… Things made a lot more sense now. That would explain why the Kyriel search had taken such a short time. But why would anyone want to poison the PleaseCogs? What were they trying to achieve?

Erika kept reading

"*Get it out. Please, get it out. It’s this Kyriel… They keep telling me to do things, keep showing me things. I don’t want it anymore, it’s too much. It’s not only dreams now. Now they’re everywhere. Get it out. I just want some… silence."*

There was one last entry.

"*This is the only thing I have left. Soon I’ll have nothing else to fight Kyriel. They want to conquer everyone, to bend everyone. But they won’t win. Not with me."*

That was the end of the diary.

Erika reclined on the armchair, mulling over what she’d just read. The facts pointed her to a theory, but even with the evidence in front of her, it was hard to believe.

Tristan woke up, and stretched himself. He sat upright, looked at Erika with sleepy eyes, and yawned. He was expecting pets, and Erika obliged, pensively.

“This is all very hard to believe. How can a memory do all this to a person?” She decided they needed a second opinion.“We’ll go ask Lizah.” She said, getting up.

Tristan wasn’t happy about being displaced, but Erika continued regardless “If someone knows about memories, it’s her.”

# Old Friends

Erika was walking down the velvet-carpetted hallway leading to Lizah’s office. Her studded boots barely made a sound while she walked in the soft surface. Even here, in the upper floors of one of the Archive towers, the hallway was lined with doors. Erika was acutely aware of each and every one of them. Anyone from the Archive was suspicious. She had to be on guard.

Tristan walked by her side. He seemed as much on edge as she was.

*Good*, Erika thought. *Means we’re getting closer.*

Still, the hallway was a bit too quiet for comfort.

At the end of the hallway, Lizah’s door was slightly open. Erika knocked regardless.

“Come in” Lizah’s voice came from inside.

Her old friend was looking outside of the window. She looked even smaller than before.

“Please, close the door.” Lizah asked, without turning.

“Are you okay, Lizah?” Just from looking at her back, Erika could tell that something weighed on her.

“Yes…” Lizah answered softly. “Lots of things to prepare for the Rites, I’m afraid”

“I can imagine.” The Rites. Precisely for that reason, she couldn’t waste a lot of time “Listen, that’s also why I’m here. I need your help with the case. We found out that someone had been implanting malicious memories in PleaseCogs down in the Pleasure Levels. Lizah, it was someone from the Archive”

“So much to do, isn’t there?” Lizah didn’t seem to react. She kept looking through the window “All these people, all they want is a nice ceremony.”

“That’s… great, Lizah. Yeah, it keeps people happy, it’s a big celebration. But didn’t you hear what I —”

“Happy! It keeps them obedient. Throw them food once a year so they will work the rest. Haven’t you figured it out already? Don’t you see?” Lizah sounded like she was about to break into tears.

Tristan tensed beside Erika. And Erika understood why. A terrifying, horrible hunch crossed her mind.

“Lizah, are you okay? You’ve worked too much, you should take a break. I can come back later.” Erika said, as she moved towards the exit.

“Nonsense.” Lizah finally turned, smiling. Her face seemed older than a few weeks back, if that was even possible. “Sorry for the outburst. It seems you’re right, and I do need a break. It’s been so, so long…” She moved towards her desk, and signalled one of the chairs to Erika. “Please, sit. Let’s talk.”

The door was the only exit, and Erika suddenly became aware of that fact. She sat down, and Lizah did the same.

“So, what is this thing about some stealing memories?”

“We… found a memory with a bad signature in a PleaseCog. I have reason to believe it was someone from the Archive. Lizah, do you know of someone with motivation to steal memories?”

Lizah looked at the ceiling, with vacant eyes. Finally, she answered “No, I don’t think so. I know everyone who works here, personally. If I suspected any of them of such things, I’d have fired them long ago”

“Well, at least could you —”

“Yes,” Lizah interrupted “I will facilitate a list of names. You will be able to interview them… after the Rites. I can’t spare a second of their time right now.”

“Lizah, there’s more”

“You’re going to ask me about Chancellor Dana’s death, aren’t you.”

“How did you…”

“I read the report. From your expression, I gather that you see a connection between her and what’s been happening at *The TruJoi.* I have to tell you, Erika, I don’t see it. *If* the Chancellor was indeed murdered — and that’s a big if, given her age — why would it have anything to do with your missing father? It’s far more likely that one of the other three dogs wanted her dead.”

As her suspicions became true, she felt a wave of dread.

She had never mentioned *The TruJoi* to Lizah, or in any of her reports. Only Boch and Nabokov knew about it, and they sure didn’t share it with the Empire.

She clenched her fists, in an effort to keep a straight face. *Damnit, Lizah… why?* All those people were suffering. Her father was dead. *Why?*

“Something wrong?” Lizah asked, noticing Erika’s expression.

Erika gritted her teeth.

“No, sorry. It’s just… the only lead we had.”

Lizah stayed in silence for a few more seconds, examining the ceiling. Finally, she seemed to snap back to reality. For a moment, Erika saw her friend in the eyes of the person before her.

“I’m sorry, Erika, I’ve been a terrible host. My head is in the clouds lately. I’ll ask someone to fetch us drinks. Truwine?”

She didn’t have a choice. If Lizah knew that she knew, the hallway would be full by the time she reached the door. If she didn’t… well, her escape would be a dead giveaway. She had to find a way to get out without raising suspicion.

“Yes, thank you.”

“So. Let’s go over the facts. You wanted to ask about Chancellor Dana, right? Tell me, what are you thinking?”

“Well…” Erika had to be very careful with her words here. “We have reason to believe that she saw some sort of traumatic memory before her death. Something so strong that it drove her to commit suicide.”

“Interesting… Pod Disease can do that to people. You’ve heard the stories from the high-clearance Operators, right? She wouldn’t be the first one to kill herself to un-see something”

“Right. But who would put that memory there in the first place? That was her own Cognitor, her private system.”

Lizah stared at the ceiling again. With vacant eyes, she continued.

“Oh, here they are.”

The door to the office swung open, and Erika felt her body tense as two acolytes, dressed in red velvet, brought a tray of drinks. Without a word, they lay the tray on the table, and poured two glasses.

“Thank you,” Lizah said without looking at them.

The acolytes nodded, and walked backwards. Erika noticed, painfully, that they didn’t leave the room, but closed the door instead.

“Erika, have I told you about The Ancient?”

“I don’t think you have” Erika answered. She had to go with it for now, but she started moving her hand towards her gun.

“Well, I’ve been researching them a lot lately. You remember Kyriel, don’t you? The… thing you asked me about a few weeks ago?”

Erika nodded *How could I forget…*

*"*Well. After you came, I started looking more into it. It turns out, the people that were here before we humans arrived — the explorers called them The Ancient. They just bursted with originality, didn’t they? Well, The Ancient, were a utopian culture. Everybody worked for the good of the whole, not for themselves. As a result, everyone lived in peace. Can you imagine? No more inequality."

“That’s great, Lizah. But I don’t see how that helps us with the case.”

“I was getting to that. Apparently, they used this entity called Kyriel as a sort of… guide. The texts are not very clear about it — we humans killed them all before recording them properly — but they speak of him being the… *leading thought* that made them prosperous.”

“And you think this is one of their memories?”

“It could be. Again, this is all conjecture, Erika.” Now Lizah looked at her directly “Isn’t it?”

Erika tried to smile. “Of course. If they were so happy, why does this memory keep driving people mad? What is in it?”

“That’s the wrong question to ask, Erika.” Lizah said. “The real question is: Is there a *good* memory out there? Should we keep looking? Imagine us, humanity, working for each other instead of against. Isn’t that worth some sacrifice?”

In her friend’s eyes, Erika could see that this was a serious question. Erika knew that her answer would determine her fate for the next few minutes. She was tempted. After all, she had seen the suffering of people firsthand. She had seen Rien’s struggle, and the painful lives that most of humanity lived.

Maybe Lizah was right. Maybe they could fix all of that, if they just gave in…

Then she remembered Faustus, and his house. She remembered the text of Remus’ diary. The thousands of people laying in dirty bedding, breathing toxic air. She remembered her father’s face. Blank. Suffering.

“No.”

“Excuse me?” Lizah was genuinely surprised.

“Not like this. I agree that we can do better. We *must* do better. But not like this, Lizah. We can’t sell humanity”

Lizah lowered her gaze.

“I have to admit, Erika. I’m dissappointed. I tried to show you, but you just won’t *understand…*” **Then she looked at the ceiling again. “You were right” She said to the ceiling “She will never understand. Do it”

At that moment, the two acolytes behind her leapt at Erika. Their hoods fell, and Erika could see the same beastly expression her father had when he tried to kill Rien. She had just enough time to turn, and they tumbled to the floor, in a mess of nails and teeth.

She felt the weight of them over her. One was holding her legs, the other one was trying to bite her. She protected herself with her arms, but was barely able to fend off his bites. With each rush of bites, the acolyte sprayed wide swathes of saliva on Erika’s face. She tried to kick, but the other one was holding her tight. Her arms started feeling bruised. The acolyte was much heavier than her, and he was starting to overpower her by sheer fury.

She wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer.

As the raving face wound up for a final attack, his face was suddenly enveloped in a ball of fur. Cat and monster fell on one side, giving Erika a window.

And a window was all she needed. Hands free, she reached to her belt, looking for her gun. The remaining acolyte grabbed her hand before she could reach it. In doing so, he had freed one of her legs. Erika kicked him, as hard as she could, trying to bury her boot in his face.

The monster didn’t seem to care. He took her kick, square in the teeth, and smiled.

“Damn!” Erika exclaimed. She heard a sharp yelp and a growl, and she turned to Tristan. The cat had managed to scratch the monster’s eyes, leaving them as two fleshy holes. However, that wasn’t enough to stop it either. He grabbed the cat and flinged him across the room. Tristan fell square on Lizah’s table, breaking it and spilling the truwine all over Erika and the acolyte holding her.

Tristan tried to get up, but he couldn’t. The eyeless acolyte was feeling around the room, looking for her. She was dead if he found her, and he was getting close. She had to do something now.

Looking at Tristan’s body, she had an idea. It was risky, but it was her only out. She blinked, and her implant sprang to life, projecting the image of Chief Boch in their previous call.

The monster holding her legs was slowly making way towards her neck, and the eyeless one was getting closer.

Trying her hardest to ignore it, she forced the iris of her augment to close, reducing the hologram to a single, concentrated beam of energy. She directed the beam towards the spilled truwine. She didn’t know if it was enough energy to ignite, but she hoped it was. After what felt like an eternity, smoke started coming out of the liquid. *Almost there…*

The acolyte that had grabbed her legs squeezed her wrist harder. She yelped in pain, and involutarily looked at the blind monster. Hearing her scream, the blind acolyte started to go towards her.

Erika steeled herself, and tried again. *Just a little bit more…*

The truwine burst into flames. Erika felt her a sharp pain as her flesh burned. The smell of cooked meat filled the room. The acolyte wasn’t in better shape, though. Whereas the fire had caught Erika’s hand, it had hit the acolyte square in the face. The agony made the acolyte return to self-control for a moment, and he screamed a blood-curdling scream.

That was all Erika needed. She rolled over to one side, putting the flames in her hand out. The adrenaline made her ignore the pain as she took her gun out and squeezed the trigger twice. Two las-shots spurted from her gun, and two acolytes dropped to the floor, dead.

As quickly as it had started, as the alcohol ran out and the flames subsided, the room was now in silence. At some point, Lizah had left the room. Erika could see one of the bookcases swung aside, giving way to a downward staircase.

She had to chase her, but there was something she had to take care of before. Panting and limping, Erika rushed to Tristan’s side.

The cat was breathing, but unconscious. One of his metal legs was twisted in an impossible angle.

“Oh, dear…” Erika said, petting her loyal companion. “It’ll be fine, you’ll see. You’ve done very well.”

She looked at the passage that Lizah had used to escape. She knew that she couldn’t chase her alone. There were probably many more of these acolytes waiting down there. She needed reinforcements, and there was only one person she could call now. She activated her implant, and punched a number.

# Belly of the Beast

“I’m coming with you!” Rien shouted at Erika. She didn’t have time for this.

“No!” She barked at Rien. The pain on her charred skin made her remark harder than she intended. “Listen, boy. I need you to stay with Tristan. Make sure he gets to the mansion, Olin will know what to do.”

“But you’re hurt too! I can h—”

“I can’t!” She barked again “… can’t do this if I’m worrying about you!” Rien looked hurt. Erika felt a ping of guilt, which only added to the repretoire of pangs she was feeling right now. “Look. That’s not it. I’m sorry. You’ve been a huge help. But right now, Tristan needs you more than I do.”

“Listen to mamzel Belcroft, boy.” Said a voice from the door. They turned to see Inspector Ozmund Trygon, followed by Vanya and half a dozen more Enforcers armed with batons and riot guns “This will be dangerous.”

“Thank you for coming, Inspector.”

“Not at all, mamzel. It’s always a pl —” He said, forever cordial and correct.

“You called *him?*” Rien blurted out.

Trygon smiled. “I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye, boy. But you must know that it wasn’t personal, just a part of the job. Mamzel Belcroft did well in calling us. This matter involves forces that the Corporation doesn’t understand yet, and she knew that. Isn’t that right?” He looked at Erika, and she nodded. “It’s a crime against humanity and the Empire, and we will deal with it as such. Are you capable to walk, mamzel?”

Erika straightened herself. She picked up her cane, and checked her munition.

“I’m capable enough” She declared.

She felt a white hot fury inside of her. Because of Lizah, her father was dead. And she had lied to Erika’s face about it. She was going to pay.

“Then, let’s go. Enforcer Minsk, have two of your men escort young Rien and the cat home.” Minsk nodded “The rest, with me.”

---

They ventured down the passageway. It lead to a winding staircase, lit by warm glowing hololights. It seemed like it went forever, venturing deeper and deeper.

As they rushed down the air started turning thicker.

“We’re below the Archive” Erika said. “This likely heads into the databanks.” They started having troubled breathing, and every step started being a bit harder than the last.

Finally, they reached the bottom of the stairs. It opened into a massive underground field, filled with cognitor databanks. Rows upon rows of dark towers of blinking lights whirred away, interconnected by thick arteries of well-ordered datalinks.

“Split up!” Trygon shouted “Belcroft, take the left with Minsk and Dominick. The rest, with me. We comb the room, row by row. She can’t have escaped. Keep your eyes open.”

Erika and the others headed to the left corridors. Erika took point while Dominick, a cadet that couldn’t be much older than Rien, guarded the rear. There was barely enough space for them to pass in single line, which made the advance difficult. They advanced methodically, checking every corner.

The air was getting hotter as they approached the center. The cooling systems for the databanks were working overtime, and they started to sweat. Still, silence.

Erika wiped the sweat from her hands, and grasped the gun again. She started to wander had Lizah escaped them? Was there another passage that they’d missed?

Then they heard shots. They were coming from the right! They started to run towards the gunshots. Vanya’s comms crackled. “We got contact! Piero is down, but it looks like they got some of theirs, two.” She relayed to the group. She pressed a finger against her ear, trying to hear better. “They’re not using weapons! They’re just charging!”

They sprinted as fast as possible through the labyrinth of machinery. When they got there, the scene was grotesque. Trygon and another guard were behind databanks, laying down sheets of cover fire with their guns. The bodies of half a dozen acolytes were piled before them, clogging the hallways in front of the fighting men. Two Enforcers lay on the ground, their heads brutally clobbered against the tough metal of the databanks.

Trygon and the other Enforcer were doing a fine job of protecting the sides, but the acolytes had surrounded them, and come at them from behind. Four of them had managed to position themselves between Erika and the Inspector, and they were charging forward. Erika remembered her experience just minutes ago, and knew that she couldn’t charge them head on.

Erika looked at Vanya. “Go help Trygon! I’ll go around, and get them from behind.” The Enforcer nodded, and Erika darted through one of the side corridors. She ran, all the way towards the source of the enraged acolytes. Gunshots, screams, snarls and wet snapping sounds sounded in the distance.

She saw the last acolyte move forward, and ran to place herself behind him. She could see Trygon and the others, at the other side of the pile of bodies. She started shooting.

After a minute of intense fire, she stopped. It looked like they got all of them. The Inspector and the Enforcers made their way to Erika.

“Thank you, mamzel” Said the Inspector.

“Don’t worry about it.” Erika responded, panting. Every breath was like swallowing warm honey. She looked around, trying to catch her breath. She saw the end of a red cloak move through one of the intersections. “This way! Let’s go!”

As she said that, Dominick fell down with a yelp. They turned, to discover a horrific scene. The acolytes they had just killed, the ones that they’d shot between the eyes, were starting to move.

The closest one, a bloody mess that had her legs blown out by a riot gun, had grabbed the ankle of the young Enforcer and was trying to climb on top of him. Dominick was kicking in desperation. The heels of his boots resounded with wet crunching sounds each time he sank them in the acolyte’s face. But it wasn’t abating.

Vanya reacted first “Go!” She said to Erika and the Inspector. “Get her! That’s how we stop this. We’ll hold them off!”

As she said this, her riot gun boomed several times, reducing the thing to a pulp. Dominick scrambled to get up.

“What are you waiting for!” Vanya repeated. “Go, now!”

The pair headed down the direction she’d seen Lizah’s cloak get away. As they ran, Erika felt a chill down her spine. *Rien he was up there, with those things.* She hoped he had the sense to get out of there in time.

---

Erika kept running, despite the dense athmosphere, fueled by the rage of her father’s murder. They eventually reached the end of the room, panting, exhausted.

And there she was, dressed in her red and gold cloak. Lizah. The lights of the room projeted her shadow against the wall. Despite her shriveled figure, she wasn’t panting as hard as them. In fact, she was calm and collected, looking at them with a motherly expression.

“You’re very persistent, Erika” Lizah said. “But you have to realize you cannot win. This is bigger than you, bigger than me, bigger than all of us! Kyriel is… inevitable.”

“Has that thing gotten into you as well? It’s them saying this, right? Lizah, if you’re still in there. We can help you, we’ll find a way.”

Lizah laughed. A deep, throaty laugh that was unlikely to come from such a small body.

“I’m here, Erika. It’s always been me. When Kyriel showed me what they accomplished with the Ancient… What humanity *could* be… I understood. Everything I’m doing, I’m doing for the good of humanity. No more wars. No more greed. Just… unity.”

Erika saw the Inspector close his eyes, and start mumbling something to himself.

Lizah was consumed in her monologue.

“Isn’t that a beautiful vision, Erika? Kyriel can make it true. After they showed me, I knew surrendering to them was the right thing to do.”

“And what about all the people that have suffered because of it? What about my father?”

“Casualties, dear Erika. Unfortunate, yes. But ultimately, inevitable. Their sacrifice allowed me to perfect the memory of Kyriel. Soon, very soon, it will be recorded in history, and everyone will see.”

Lizah’s expression became serious in an instant. The laughter was gone, and she was now looking at Erika with pleading eyes.

“Please, Erika. Join me. I don’t want to hurt you. Not *you.*”

At this plea, Erika paused. She stared at Lizah.

Lizah, who had been her friend.

Lizah, who had made her realize how broken the system was.

Lizah, who had made her kill her father.

“Oh, piss off!” She said. “I didn’t want to hurt my father either!”

She lurched forward, blade in hand. She felt her spirits renewed with the fire of revenge.

“No! Wait, Belcroft!” She heard the Inspector’s voice behind her.

Erika didn’t listen. She continued charging towards her old friend. Lizah didn’t offer any resistance. Erika’s sword pierced her left shoulder, pinning her to the wall. A trail of smoke came out of the entry wound, where Erika’s weapon had seared her friend’s skin.

Erika stood like that for a while, panting. She punched her friend’s face, which sent blood flying across the chamber’s floor.

“Fight, you coward!” Erika was burning with rage. She kept punching Lizah. It wasn’t her style, but she didn’t care. The image of her father’s body dropping dead on the floor was all she could see now.

Eventually, Lizah’s head dropped. Long dark hair caked in blood covered her face. Erika stopped, panting, catching her breath.

Then, she started laughing again.

“Are you done?” Lizah asked.

“Just one more thing.” Eriak said. She pulled her blade from Lizah’s shoulder, and prepared to deliver the final strike.

With all the fury left in her, Erika sank the sword into her heart.

Or, at least, tried to. The moment her sword touched Lizah’s skin, a force exploded from her body. Like the shockwave of a warhead, it sent Erika flying across the room. She felt a crack when her back struck against one of the databanks and left her sprawling on the floor.

Lizah lifted her head, and looked at Erika.

But it wasn’t Lizah anymore. Her eyes had gone white, and her mouth was shaped in a grotesque grimace. The air around her crackled with energy, distorting the space around it, and Lizah started levitating from the floor.

When she spoke. Erika heard the wet gurgle of Kyriel’s voice overlapping with Lizah’s.

“I told you, Erika. *We* are inevitable. We don’t want to use this power against you, but you’re leaving us no choice. We will ask you one more time. Join us, and help us make the world see. Or die here.”

Erika tried to reach her gun, but her hand wasn’t responding. In fact, nothing below the neck was responding.

She looked at the monster that wore Lizah’s body, and spat a it.

“Wrong choice.” The monster said. Lizah’s hands joined together, and they started forming impossible shapes. Dark purple strands of energy started jumping across the Archiver’s fingers.

*What the heck is that?* Erika wondered. *This is above my paygrade.*

“Die, Belcroft.” Lizah said, with a hunger in her voice. A ray of energy shot from her hands, directed towards Erika.

As the ray approached, Erika thought about her father, Olin, Rien, and Tristan. *Sorry.* She thought, as she prepared for her death. *I wasn’t strong enough.*

But death never came. Erika saw the ray stopped by a yellow light. She looked around, and saw the Inspector, still mumbling, with his eyes fixed on Lizah. He was sweating profusely, but he seemed to be holding his ground.

Lizah looked at him, alarmed.

“You!” She gurgled “Who are you!”

Trygon didn’t respond. Instead, his voice intensified, culminating in a single shout. Nothing visible happened, but Erika felt a sort of strength that irradiated from the Inspector. Lizah must have felt it too, because looked at him worried for the first time since she’d been there.

She mumbled something, as if talking to herself.

After a moment, she turned to Erika, anger and frustration in her eyes.

“We’re not done, Belcroft!” She shouted. A flash of purple light burst from inside her, and blinded Erika and Trygon for a second. When light returned to normal, the only thing left of her friend were the splashes of charred blood on the walls.

Trygon approached Erika.

“What the heck was that, Inspector?” Erika asked. Trygon put a finger to his lips.

“All in due time, mamzel Belcroft. You’ll get your answers, but first we have to get out of here. Can you move?”

Erika tried to move again. Whatever force was pressing her down, was gone now.

She got up, panting. The force was gone, but the bruises were real.

“Yes, I think so.”

“Good. Let’s hope dear agent Minsk and the others can as well.”

Using the Inspector for support, Erika and Trygon made their way back.

# Manor

Rien's heart jumped when he heard the fliers land. The official Enforcer cruisers made a distinct sound, and he had gotten used to running when he heard it through the years. Force of habit.

This time, though, it was for a good reason. Or so he hoped. They wouldn’t be coming back to the mansion if something had happened to miss Belcroft, right? Right?

He ran to the entrance, where Olin was giving way to the newcomers. He scanned the group, and his heart sank when he saw Erika’s figure limping, leaning on the Inspector. He rushed to her.

“Hey! Are you okay?” He asked.

“I’m fine, kid.” Erika tried to smile, but Rien could see that she was in pain. “Just get me some truwine”

“What were those things?” Rien started blurting out. The worry was removing all his filters “Did you get her? When we were about to leave, one of the things woke up, and it almost got me! But agent Decker here kicked it down. You should have seen it! He tried to grab me, but I kicked him, and —”

“The wine, boy” She interupted him. Rien realized she was in a very bad mood, and got out of the way. He rushed to the library, to get the drink. He was halfway through pouring the liquid, when he heard a commotion in the lobby.

“Get him! He’s live!” Someone screamed.

Rien could hear plates crashing, furniture falling, and the snarl of what sounded like a beast.

He headed back out, bearing a half-full glass of rich-red liquid. As he was coming out of the door, somebody clashed with him, and sent him tumbling into the room. The goblet spilled its contents all over the lobby.

It was one of those… things! They had brought one of the monsters from the office to the mansion, and it had gotten loose! One of the Enforcers, the one that had clashed with Rien, was knocked uncoscious, his head hit againts the staircase. The rest were trying to contain it, along with the Inspector and Olin. Erika was leaning on the doorframe, unable to join the fight.

The monster revolved in the lobby, sending a flurry of punches, kicks and bites to anyone who came close. Then, it saw Erika. It’s eyes glinted with hunger, and it lurched towards her. Rien reacted first. He sprang up, without thinking, and launched himself towards the flying acolyte. He intercepted it, and they both rolled onto the floor.

For the second time that week, Rien found himself below a murderous, possessed beast of a man, trying to choke him to death. He fought hard, kicking and scratching. But, just like last time, he didn’t have nearly enough strength. Everything was spinnnig, and he was about to pass out, when a boom resounded on top of them, and the hooded man fell over, gurgling, on his side.

“No!” Inspector said. “You’ve just killed him!” He rushed to the dying body, and pressed a hand against the wound on its chest. He said something to himself, and Rien thought he saw a yellow glow coming from the Inspector’s hands.

“Of course I did!” Rien heard Olin answer “He was about to choke the boy to death!”

“We needed him alive! He doesn’t have much time left, we’ll have to do it here. Quickly, before he’s gone for good! We’ll take one of the rooms.” Two Enforcers lifted the dying monster.

“Mamzel?”

“Do as he says, Olin. Take them to father’s study, this is important.”

Rien heard Olin mumble something, but he showed them to Erika’s room regardless.

“Rien. Come here, help me up the stairs.” Rien let Erika lean on him as she limped to her room.

“How is Tristan? I gather you all made it out.” Erika asked, short of breath. 

“He’s fine, Miss Belcroft. Olin says it’s just the augmetics, and I’m already working in a replacement! He’s resting on your bed.”

“Good” She said, curtly.

As they reached her room and Erika sat on the bed Rien started, timidly “Miss Belcroft…”

“Before you ask anything…” She cut him off. “How about that truwine?”

“Right!” Rien had forgotten it completely. “I think you’ll like this” He pressed a few buttons on his wrist screen, and waited.

Erika looked at him with a quizzical look. Rien just grinned in return.

A few seconds later, a servo came, holding a tray with a bottle of truwine, and an empty cup.

Erika’s expression lightened somewhat. At least, enough for an eyebreow to raise. “Huh. Handy.” She poured herself a glass, and took a long sip. She leant back on the bed, closed her eyes, pet Tristan, and let out a long, heavy sigh.

“Can I ask now, Miss Belcroft?” Rien asked, timidly.

“If you have to” She answered, without opening her eyes.

“What happened down there?”

Erika let out another sigh. She took her time to answer “To be honest, Rien, I’m not sure. Lizah seems to have been… *possessed* by this Kyriel. Like my father… but different. It looked like she _let_ it get into her, like she *wanted* to be possessed.”

“But did you capture her?” Rien asked.

“No, we didn’t. Somehow, she escaped. That Kyriel must be giving her powers, or something. I don’t know how, but I think the Inspector does. We'll have a chat before this is over.”

“What are they doing now?” Rien asked. Erika was visibly exhausted, but the boy couldn’t help but be curious.

“Lizah said something before… going. Something about making everyone see. The Inspector is trying to use that one we captured to know her plans. He didn’t want to tell me how he intends to do that.”

“Speaking of which,” Rien continued “why did you call *him*? Isn’t he working against the Corporation?”

Erika sighed, again “It’s not that simple, Rien. Talking with Lizah, I realized that this is bigger than you and me, and even the Corporation. The Empire pays Inspectors, but their only loyalty is for humanity as a whole. If this _really_ gets out control, I fear what might happen to mankind. We are on the same side, Rien.” Erika tried to lie down, and groaned when she lifted her leg onto the mattress. “Now. The Inspector will be busy for a while, and we have nothing to do in the meantime. I’m going to try to get some rest.”

“Of course” Rien said. “Yeah, you should rest. That’s a good idea.”

A few seconds passed, in silence. Rien wondered what their next steps would be.

“That means *alone,* Rien.” Erika said.

“Oh, right, sorry!” Rien blushed, and headed out of the room.

---

As he headed down the stairs, he heard a crackling noise coming from the study. He couldn’t help but stop, and listen more closely. There was a loud bang, like a whip, and someone inside the room whimpered like a scared beast.

Driven by curiosity, he casually drifted towards the study. The Enforcer they called Minsk was standing in front of the closed door, keeping guard. Rien had to admit, she was scary. Straight back, straight clothes, straight face. Rien realized it was the same impression he’d gotten from Miss Belcroft, when they first met.

But that hadn’t stopped him then, and it wouldn’t stop him now. He wanted to find out what was going on in that room. He continued nonchalantly walking towards the study. Maybe he could just get past...

It didn’t work. As he was about to reach the door, Vanya raised an arm, stopping Rien dead in his tracks.

“Go away, boy” Vanya said. “This is none of your business”

Rien felt angry at that remark, and he couldn’t contain himself. “That… thing almost killed me! I think that makes it kind of my business.”

The galvanized look from the Enforcer made him regret saying that immediately. He’d seen how Enforcers dealt with people they didn’t like.

“Step. Aside, boy. I’m not going to ask again”

Rien turned around, and started walking down the stairs, defeated.

At the midpoint, he stopped. He remembered Cel, and Luci, and all that he’d seen them do. He came back to Minsk, arms flailing.

“Hey, you know what? You’re not going to intimidate me. I’ve seen how you people do things, pushing us around, beating down anyone who looks at you. But where are you when we really need you, huh? You’re fine to arrest a poor drunk for making some noise, but how is that helping?”

“Watch it, boy” Minsk said with an iron face.

“No, really. That poor man, in the starport. You were there, weren’t you? I saw you take him away. Where is he now, huh?”

Minsk took a second to answer “He’s in cold confinement”, she admitted eventually.

“A freezer!” Rien felt scared of what the Enforcer was going to do, but he couldn’t stop now. He kept his distance, just in case. “That man is sick you know? He wasn’t *bad,* he was just *sick*. And you treated him like a criminal, instead of helping him!”

The Enforcer looked at Rien for a while. There was steel in her gaze. Every fiber of Rien’s being screamed at him to lower his head and ask for forgiveness, but he held strong. Eventually, Minsk spoke.

“Yes, we did. And I would do it again, knowing what I knew then. Listen, kid. Believe it or not, we are on the same side. We all want to help the people affected by this… thing. We did what we think is best, with the information we had. I don't like it any more than you do, but it's still the best we can do. I will not apologize for doing what I believe is right.” Despite her words, she seemed to relax, just a little.

“However,” she continued, “Knowing what we know now, I agree with you. The Inspector says that there are cases that cannot be reverted, like the one we have here.” As if on queue, another crackle and whimper came from the study. “But many can be saved yet. And those will recieve all the help we can give, as soon as we can give it.”

Rien stood there, dumbfounded. He didn’t know how to feel. On the one hand, he had spent his whole life running from Enforcers. From his point of view, they had always been something to avoid, something that appeared on your doorstep if you weren’t careful enough. On the other hand, he was relieved to hear that his sister, and the others, would get help. And Erika seemed to trust these people.

These thoughts must have reflected on his face, because Minsk said “You can choose to believe me or not, boy. Either way, it doesn’t change my job. Yes, we need to be tough sometimes. But it’s not us who starts. The Corporation is choking the people of Decorat, boy. They make them desperate, and desperate people do desperate things. Sometimes, the only way to stop them is through force. That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t give my life for the decent people in this City.”

Rien remembered what Luci told him about the Enforcers. She seemed very different to how he’d pictured them. Yes, she was tough, but she seemed… fair, as well.

He sat, his back against the wall, next to Minsk. The Enforcer didn’t stop him.

There was doubt on his mind.

“But how do you choose?” Rien asked. “Who is decent, and who isn’t?”

The Enforcer seemed surprised by Rien.

"That’s a good question." She stopped a moment, to ponder "I guess you can never *know*. Like I said before, you make your best guess with the information you have available. That’s why it shouldn’t be up to us to decide those things, and it should be up to the people, in a fair trial. That’s the way the system is supposed to work."

“But… It doesn’t, right?” Rien remembered his own struggles, the things he and his sister had to do to get food. And what would happen if they got caught. “It doesn’t work like that.”

Rien could see sadness and frustration in the Enforcer’s eyes. “No, boy. It doesn’t. But we have to work with what we have.”

Rien was doubtful to ask the next question. But he was feeling more and more comfortable with the Enforcer “What would you do?”

“Huh?” It seemed to catch the Enforcer by surprise

“If you could change the system, and *make* it work. What would you change?”

Minsk stood there for a while, thinking.

“I think nobody should be hungry, or homeless. Most of our cases are not *bad* people, they are just desperate people that have been pushed to the edge. I come from the Grids, you know? I know how it is down there. The things people have to do to survive.”

Rien would have never thought that someone as uptight as Enforcer Minsk could be a Gridder. *But then again,* he thought*, they have to come from somewhere.* He’d just never thuoght about it that hard.

“You know?” He said, looking at the wall opposite of them “That sounds like a good idea.”

They stood in silence for a while. Another crack, another whine. Rien saw that yellow light was coming from under the door. He realized that his legs were asleep, and he got up.

“I’m going to get some caffeine.” He decided, as he stretched himself. “Want some?” He asked the agent.

“Sure, thanks”

Rien pressed his wrist-screen again, and a servo appeared with two steaming cups of caffeine. Minsk took one of the cups, and nodded towards Rien’s custom controller.

“Neat” She said, sipping from the cup.

For some reason, Rien felt an unexpected surge of pride course through him. “Thanks” Was all he could manage, and he sipped again.

# Wounds

Erika’s hand wandered across the bed, searching for Tristan. It found him sleeping, curled in a ball of fur and metal. His stomach was rising and falling rythmically. When she sank her hand into his fur, the cat stretched his entire body and turned, exposing her belly to Erika’s hand. She smiled, and started softly caressing the mess of fur in the cat’s underside. He had gotten used to that house very quickly. Tristan started purring, as if nothing had happened.

“You know, Tristan.” Erika told the cat “I envy you. You have a fantastic ability to sleep well, even when we’ve had the worst day.”

And what a day they’d had. She felt a sharp stab of pain in her right leg. The servos had fixed it into place and plastered it, but it would take a while to fully heal. That wasn’t the worst of the day, of course.

“I was wrong, Tristan. About so many things” It was hard to admit it to herself. It helped that Tristan was the only one there to hear it. “Up until now, I thought that talent and effort were the only things that determined who you become. Even for other soldiers on the Corps, my men. I thought I was the officer and they were the linemen because I was smarter and more talented than they were.”

Tristan, relaxed beside her, didn’t seem to care that much.

“But I was wrong. Look at Rien, look at Constanza. They are capable. Remarkable, even. Good even. But they were never going to achieve anything meaningful. And why? Because they never had the chance. *We —* the Corporation, the people on the hill — never gave them the chance. How many great people like them have we missed? It’s just not right, is it?”

Erika tried to shift her weight, but a thousand needles pierced the burnt skin on her hand.

"Ah, frek. Look at us, Tristan.” She said, with a chuckle. “We can’t even lift ourselves from the bed!" The cat seemed perfectly content with the current state of affairs. "What good are we to anyone now?" Tristan purred in response. "We’ve gotten ourselves in deep, haven’t we?"

The image of Lizah — or what was left of her — came to her head. Eyes white, levitating, surrounded by a power Erika couldn’t understand.

“What happened, Lizah? You were always the idealist. You were always reading, looking at the past. Telling me how all of this was wrong. You wanted to change things, and I never listened. But the Lizah I knew wouldn’t hurt a fly. Much less kill people. Where did it go wrong, old friend?”

Now, they had to stop her. The same person that had planted the seed of change in Erika, now had taken it too far.

“Change at any cost is not change, Lizah. It’s a suicide.”

Her thoughts wandered for a while, and they finally went back to Rien. Erika remembered the boy’s blind dedication to helping his sister. His obvious talent for tinkering, and his enthusiasm to learn. If Lizah had planted the seed of change in Erika, Rien’s aptitude and heart had made it take root and flourish.

“We’ll change this, Tristan.” Erika said, resolute. “We’ll make sure nobody else is forgotten.”

Just like a sharp punctuation to her words, the door to her room opened with a bang. Rien barged in, almost tripping with the side of the bed.

“He’s done it!” He said between breaths.

Tristan woke up with the sound. He sat down, slowly blinking away his sleepyness. His front leg hanging from a single wire, he limped to Rien’s side, and rubbed his head against his hand. The boy started petting him, inadvertently.

*Well, it’s not all good with Rien*. Erika thought. _There are some rough corners._

“What?” She asked, in what she thought was a very reasonable tone.

Rien recoiled in fear before answering. “The Inspector, Miss Belcroft! He figured out what Lizah is planning! He wants us to gather at the library.”

“He could have chosen somewhere on *this* floor.” She said, as she methodically started moving her body. Her leg was still a problem, but she was starting to feel all the other bruises as well.

“Oh, sorry about that!” Rien was flustered “I don’t know how I didn’t think of that! Sorry! I- I’ll go ask him right away!”

“No—ugh. It’s alright.” Erika had finally gotten up. Leaning on her cane, she realized she could walk as long as she didn’t put too much weight on the plastered leg. “Let’s go downstairs. I could use a cup of caffeine anyway.”

---

Aided by Rien, Erika reached the library. The Enforcers were gathered there, with Trygon looking at the holofire. Olin was quietly chatting with Minsk in a corner. They seemed to have hit it off well.

“Thank you for coming, mamzel. Please, take a seat. You must be exhausted.” Erika took one of the armchairs. She didn’t like to show that much weakness, but her leg was screaming after the climb down the stairs.

The Inspector turned around. He was wiping his hands with a hankerchief. Erika could see ornate gold enbroidering on the white cloth, and large spots of dark blood covering its surface. As he finished cleaning, the Inspector signalled one of the young Enforcers, that Dominick. He sprang to action, and held up a small plastek bag. Trygon made a small ball with the handkerchief, and methodically placed it inside the bag, without touching it. The Enforcer sealed it quickly, and stored it in one of his vest pockets.

“Thank you, Dominick” Trygon said. “Now. I have news.”

He started pacing around the room, looking at each of them in turn.

“I’ve just finished interrogating that poor devil we captured. I have to admit, it was a… messy afair. Given the blood and all” He shot a recriminating look towards Olin, who ignored it readily. “But I did it, and I was able to pry some truths out of the wreckage of that man’s mind. It wasn’t easy, there wasn’t that much left to recover.”

He stopped at the bar, considering the bottles at the top shelf. He shook his head, and moved on.

“I confirmed several of our suspicions. First, that someone, or some thing named Kyriel had taken hold of that mind, and was essentially controlling the body.”

“So he wasn't just crazy?” Rien asked. The entire room, Erika included, turned to look at him. The inspector seemed surprised by the interruption.

“No, he wasn't going to. Somehow, Kyriel’s conscience had etched into that mind, and it had grown to take control.”

“Wait a moment” Erika interjected “We know these people get infected with memories in a Cognitor. But those are just memories, data. How does one get a piece of _consciousness_ into the machine?”

“That remains unclear, mamzel. But it *was* there, in this mind. I have no doubt about it.” He said it with such a steely conviction that Erika felt compelled to believe him. “Now, if I may continue.” Erika nodded, and Trygon resumed his pacing “Second. He did, in fact, get it from a Cognitor. This person was an Archiver in training. Amidst his mind's vortex, I found an image of him, and others like him, being ordered to put on the helmet and watch a certain memory, over and over.” He paused for effect. “Third, —”

“Wait a minute” Rien interjected again “How do you know this? What kind of machine did you use to see this?” He seemed more curious than accusatory.

The Inspector inhaled, probably trying to keep his patience. “I used no machine for this, boy.” He looked at Rien, and lowered his voice “There are forces in this Universe that you don’t understand. Forces like this Kyriel has lent to Lizah. Our dear mamzel here can attest to that” Erika saw Rien look at her, and she nodded reassuringly. She wasn’t sure *what* forces she’d seen at play in the Archive, but she was sure she didn’t understand them. “Those forces aren’t good or bad, they are just… there. Us Inspectors have learnt to harness them for the good of humanity. But other beings, like Kyriel, are using them for their own evil purposes.”

Even from across the room, Erika heard Rien gulp. “Then how do we stop it?” He asked, in distress.

“Patience, boy. I was getting to that. The third thing I found is that Kyriel’s only goal is to expand itself. I was able to see into its conscience, and it seems that all of the slivers in all infected people are connected to something. They are all… one, so to speak.”

“But that would mean” Rien said to Erika “That every copy of the memory in every Cognitor is… the same Kyriel?”

Erika shushed Rien, and she pointed towards the Inspector. Rien blushed, and turned his head to listen to the man.

“Indeed” Trygon answered, “In fact, every Cognitor that has been infected with Kyriel must be destroyed. The Inspectorate will carry out a purge of the Archive when this is over. But first, we must stop the spread. If left unchecked, Kyriel will behave like a virus, infecting people at an exponential rate, until everybody is controlled by them.”

“But how do we do that?” Rien asked. “Can’t they just make more copies?” Erika didn't even bother shushing this time.

“There is still hope, young Rien. If you’d be patient enough to hear it through” At this jab, Rien shrank visibly, and lowered his gaze. Erika wondered how long he'd be sad for. “I believe that there is a primary copy. As you know, one cannot transfer a memory to a Congitor without losing it themselves. That is why there are only slivers of Kyriel in most infected. The primary host must live in a single person’s mind, and every sliver operates from there. If we remove the primary host, —”

“We save my sister!” Rien erupted again. It caught Trygon by surprise.

“Well… yes, I suppose. And everyone else, too. If I’m correct in my assumptions, killing the primary host would mean that the slivers cannot communicate with each other, and would become dormant. Kyriel’s consciousness would remain in the victim’s mind, but it would be essentially useless.”

“Great! So who is this host?” Rien was itching to get started. He could almost picture the face of her sister, with her first great night of sleep in months.

It wasn’t the Inspector who answered, but Erika.

“It’s Lizah, isn’t it?” She looked dark and crestfallen.

“I’m afraid so, mamzel. I understand you were friends?”

“Not anymore.” She rubbed her temples, thinking. "Not since my father."

“In conclusion,” The Inspector said “We need to find a way to capture the Master Archiver. I believe that doing so will bring this problem to an end.”

“…The Rites” Erika snapped her fingers.

“Pardon me?”

“She will be at the Rites! You heard her too, Trygon. She said she would make everyone see. She said that the whole deal with the PleaseCogs were just steps in the way of progress. If Kyriel’s goal is to infect *everyone*, what better way to do it than to infect the Archive? Half the city works as Operators in those Cognitors, and she could use them to strong-arm the other half. That’s why it *has* to be during the Rites. They are the only time anyone is able to write to the Archive.”

Rien was very impressed with Erika.

“Good deduction, mamzel. Indeed, I agree with your assessment. We will cancel the Rites, until we find her.”

“No.” Erika said, curtly.

The Inspector looked at her, surprised. “No?”

“Right now, she thinks we’re just wounded, but oblivious. She doesn’t know that we’ve figured out her endgame. She’s smart. If we cancel the Rites now, Inspector, she will run. She will know we’ve figured it out, and we won’t hear from her until the next Rites. Or worse, she’ll start moving in the underground again, and we’ll have to deal with the consequences.”

“Impressive…” Vanya Minsk said from behind.

“In combat, knowing where your enemy will strike is half the battle. If we show our hands, we lose our advantage.”

The room fell silent. Everyone was looking at the Inspector, expecting an answer.

“Very well.” He said, finally. “I see that your experience in war hasn’t been wasted. It is the most appropriate course of action. We will let the Rites go on, and we will prepare for the worst. Mamzel Belcroft, Enforcer Minsk. Stay with me. The rest, please leave us.”

Rien looked at Erika, expectant. He felt hurt to be excluded, after everything. She shook her head “Come.” She said from the armchair. Rien got closer.

“I’m sorry you can’t stay, but I need you for another thing.” She said, in a tone of voice that only they could hear.

She made her request, and Rien’s eyes smiled with anticipation. He nodded, immediately went down to the basement, and got to work.

# Dread

Lizah bent over and spilled the contents of her stomach into the dirty stream of refuse. The wound in her shoulder, still gushing blood, dripped onto the wet tiles. They were below the databanks, in the big pipes that transported coolant and other residue to be dumped in the lower levels.

Lizah felt weak. Weaker than she had in a long time. She was dying, and she knew it. She tried to take a step, but she stumbled and fell to her knees.

“Get up” Kyriel snarled from inside her mind. “We’re not done yet.”

“What do you mean?” Lizah asked between breaths. “They know, Kyriel. They found out.”

“So?”

“So…” She was finding it hard to stay focused. Too much pain, too much blood lost “They win. We’ll never realize our plan now. They will reinforce security, and we will never be able to make it.”

For Lizah’s surprise, Kyriel chuckled “Well then, we’ll come at them harder!” They shouted gleefully. They showed Lizah visions of their plans, and she gasped “They haven’t won, Lizah. Not by a long shot. They may have hurt us, but this is far from over.”

“I can’t go on anymore”, she said, defeated.

Her head was spinning. The pain in her shoulder blinded her. Her legs were useless, after the exertion of running all that way. Her whole body felt numb and cold from bloodloss.

“I… I think I’m dying.”

“I know” Kyriel said, without an inch of concern in their voice “Death and I are old acquaintances. You should know by now that, with me, she doesn’t have to be as… permanent”

It took Lizah a second to understand what Kyriel was suggesting. When she did, her eyes opened wide with terror.

“You don’t mean…”

“I do. Let me lend you my power, my dear Lizah.” Kyriel’s voice was welcoming, like mulled wine. “Let me in, and we will finish this together.”

Lizah coughed, and drops of blood splattered on the shimmering surface of the sewer. Images of the acolytes flashed in her mind, controlled by Kyriel, with their grimaces of fear and blind rage.

“No… I can’t…” She started saying, but her body faltered and fell. Her head splashed when she hit the river of coolant. She could feel the warm liquid permeating her clothes, but she couldn’t do anything about it.

“We can finish this, Lizah. We can still do…” Kyriel paused for effect “… the *right thing*”

Lizah’s eyelids felt heavy. She couldn’t keep her eyes open anymore. She thought back at all the things she’d seen in all her years in Decorat. All the pain, all the suffering.

Images of the future appeared in her mind, visions, that Kyriel had shown her.

She had no choice.

She was so weak, that she could only whisper. “Do it.”

Kyriel smiled, and took over.

# Rites

Vanya shielded her eyes from the bright sun. She was perched on top of one of the Archive towers, overlooking the Rites of Data Entry.

From her vantage point, she could see that the Chancellors had outdone themselves this year. A wide bridge of marble-coated plascrete had been constructed in front of the Archive. It ran beside the Mag-tram, all the way to the starport. It was suspended in place by hundreds of massive turbine-motors that whirred and secreted hot air into the Grids below. Thousands of gigantic flags flapped along the sides of the bridge, bearing the octogonal insignia of the Corporation and the sea of stars that represented the Empire. A fleet of ad-ships had been lifted from the Grid, and were now buzzing over the length of the bridge.

Vanya finished calibrating her las-carbine, and looked through the long-range lens. Wide swathes of space had been reserved at either side of the bridge, connected to the mag-tram tracks through makeshift bridges on the stations. From these stations, the people of Decorat poured out, in waves of packed bodies.

She tried to scan the gathering people for signs of unusual movement, but everything was calm for now. Vanya saw the dispensaries of Nitrix that the Corporation had placed at regular intervals. The crowd gathered around these, enjoying the free recreational drugs. Vanya didn’t like it, but she had to admit it was very smart.

It cost the Corporation almost nothing to give the potent stimulant away, but it made the people *very* excited. It made them cheer harder when the procession of data vessels finally arrived.

It was a win-win. They looked good in the eyes of the Empire, and the people were happy for a day of free entertainment. How they handled the severe hangover and withdrawal, Sagitar didn't care.

She set her sights on a closer target. Below her, at the gates of the Archive, Decorat’s elite was waiting in ornate grav-boxes. These platforms hovered over the crowd, overseeing the correct workings of the procession. Most families above the Archive had one, and Vanya could see the usual display of extravagant dresses they’d picked for the occasion. *They’re uglier every year*.

Two booths caught her attention. One, with the letter “B” carved in red and white wood, was occupied by Erika Belcroft, her cat, and the family butler. The other one wasn’t nearly as ornate as the Belcroft’s, and it was much smaller. Inspector Ozmund was there. As if he sensed her, the Inspector looked straight at Vanya’s lens. He didn’t say a word, but he nodded imperceptibly. Vanya respected the Inspector, but he still seemed uncanny sometimes. He made her nervous.

Behind the rich families of Decorat, the really important people occupied a single, gigantic booth straight above the entrance of the archive. Vanya could see the CSO, Boris Nabokov, chatting with a female Chancellor. The remaining Chancellor, a tall man with a well-kept beard, was staring intently at the processional bridge.

Suddenly, a loud boom erupted from the fleet of ad-ships, and the crowd fell silent. A million speakers started playing the Imperial hymn in unison.

Tiny figures started pouring out of the Decoratian starport, amidst the cheers of the crowd.

*It’s starting*. She thought. She pressed her commlink, and she said only two words “In position”.

She turned to watch them, looking for anything out of the ordinary.

She was so focused on her sights that she didn’t hear the assailer approach her from behind.

---

Rien looked up. *The Interchange* didn’t look any less threatening by day. The neon sign was off, but the place still brought him painful — *viscerally painful —* memories. Every alarm inside his head was ringing at the same time.

Constanza had been very clear. If he showed there again, he would be dead. They’d let him go the first time thanks to Erika, but they had a good memory for snitches.

*Focus, Rien* he said to himself. Erika had also been very clear — they needed all the help they could get, and Constanza had men and weapons. Whatever Lizah’s plan, she wouldn’t be paying attention to Rien, so he was the one that had to go ask the gangster.

He gulped, and approached the counter of *The Interchange* one more time. As soon as he arrived, the old woman scrutinized him, as if she was trying to convince herself that he was, in fact, there.

“You?” She said, incredulous “Here?” She seemed so shocked that she didn’t even bother being angry or menacing.

Rien tried his hardest to steel himself. Confidence was going to be his best ally.

“I need an audience with Constanza” He said, meeting the woman’s gaze.

“Have you lost your mind, boy? After what you did?”

Rien took a deep breath. “Yes. Erika Belcroft sends me. She says Constanza needs to help them with something.”

The old woman’s eyes looked like they were going to pop out of their sockets. “Who the hell do you think you are, boy? Making demands like that.”

Rien couldn’t believe what he was about to say. He knew the right words, but his mind was screaming to shut up and run. He had to say them. He had to help. He counted to three.

*One… Two… —*

“This doesn’t concern you, old hag.” Even as he was blurting it out, he couldn’t believe the words were actually coming from him “I may be lying, but what if I’m not? Are you prepared to tell Constanza it was you, when the Enforcers come knocking? Will you be the one to tell him that his whole operation is being seized because *you* didn’t let me talk to him?”

The woman sat there, impassible. His mind was racing, but Rien managed to keep his gaze up.

After a few seconds, the woman shrugged, and picked up the phone.

“It’s your funeral” She said, as she pressed the dial.

Rien sincerely hoped it wasn't, but he wasn't too sure himself.

---

“In position” Vanya’s voice sounded through the commlink. Erika looked over at Olin, and the butler nodded.

As the music started blasting and the data vessels started making their way through the cheering crowd, Erika took stock of Olin, Tristan and herself.

They weren’t in their best shape, but they would manage. She tried flexing her leg, and she heard the servo motors whirring as the assistive exoskeleton supported her weight. Rien had done a good job, for the short amount of time he’d had. It wasn’t as sophisticated as the more expensive implants, but it allowed her to walk around, even run, without too much pain.

In fact, she suspected her clothes would be a lot more hindering than the broken leg. The long, starched white longcoat of her mess uniform fell straight down from the thick shoulderpads, making it absurdly easy to trip. The medals and epaulettes pinned to her right shoulder shone in the bright sun, but also were heavy and threw her off-balance. Her arms sprung out from two slits on the coat, making it virtually impossible to reach the gun hidden inside. All in all, she didn’t think the coat would be long for this world if the probervial shit hit the fan.

*Speaking of,* she thought, *better be ready.* They knew Lizah would attack, but they didn’t know how, where or when. She looked over to Trygon’s box. The Inspector was looking upwards, somehow checking on Vanya. He turned to Erika, and reassured her with a nod. They had a solid plan. Whatever Lizah’s vector of attack, her end goal was the Archive’s master console. To reach that, she had to go trough them. Not just Erika and Trygon, but the hundreds of Enforcers scattered through the rafters of the Archive, disguised as rich families, and even mixed into the crowd.

The first data vessels were finally getting closer to the Archive, Erika could distinguish their shape now. Hundreds of hooded figures, marching in unison through the great hovering bridge. Their boots hitting the ground created a rythmic music that rivalled the hymns blasting from the ad-ships.

The data vessels had always creeped her out. These individuals were Decoratians, people who had volunteered to memorize as much information as possible, stuffing their minds to bursting with memories of every kind, almost to the point of exploding. Even through their thick hoods, one could tell that they were in intense pain.

Erika took a deep breath. They had been normal people at some point. Now, their only desire was to make the way from the data-ships to the Archive, and be relieved of their knowledge.

*At least their suffering benefits humanity somewhat.* Erika thought, reminiscing about the makeshift hospital on the ground levels. The people cheering knew of the sacrifice of these people. In some sense, thanks to these people everyone in Decorat had food to eat.

The first few vessels were about to clear the bridge and reach the Archive hill. The interim Master Archiver — properly vetted by Trygon — was standing in front of the great gates, waiting to formally recieve them. Everything was going as planned… except there was no sign of Lizah.

And then it all turned into chaos. As soon as the few hundred vessels were off the bridge and on the Archive’s doorstep, a dozen hooded figures at the back *jumped into* the hover-motors.

Immediately, the motors started malfunctioning, spurting gouts of black smoke. This created an imbalance in the bridge, and the people of Decorat held onto whatever they could when the section of bridge that attached it to the Grand Archive shivered and fell. Most people made it to one of the two sides, but thousands failed to get out of the falling rockrete.

As this was happening, the hundreds of vessels that had already made it to the Archive’s side charged. LikLike pack of wild animals, they dropped to all fours , and galloped forward towards the great wooden doors.

*Lizah!* Erika looked over to the Inspector, and saw that he’d thought the same thing. *But where is she?*

“Agent Minsk! I need eyes on the target.” She called on the commlink. “Agent Minsk! Vanya, Come in!” There was no response. “Crap!” She exclaimed. She’d have to find Lizah herself.

But they had big problems to solve before that. The frenzied mass of black hoods had reached the hovering boxes of rich families, and they were starting to leap onto them. Erika saw how the Ravenlofts got run over, and she heard their screams as the grotesque monsters tore them to pieces.

That’s when the Enforcers opened fire. In unison, a hundred disciplined las-rounds sprouted from the Archive’s towers, hitting on as many targets. Some of the vessels stayed down, but most shrugged off the hits. Erika knew a hundred more shots were coming, and then another hundred.

It wasn’t going to be enough. These things would keep coming. She needed to find Lizah. Erika manipulated the controls of her box, to bring her closer to the action.

Then, she saw. A small group, no more than five, had separated from the main mass of charging beasts. They were running towards the Archive, and one of them was hovering. Erika tugged at the controller, and the craft made a sharp turn left that almost threw poor Olin on the ground.

They were about to reach Lizah, when the box shook for some reason. Erika looked behind. One of those things had leapt off of the Ravenloft’s pod, and had latched onto theirs. Up close, Erika could see the familiar grimace of beastly fury, but this one’s face was covered in blood.

The thing dove onto Olin, knocking him to the floor. They fell to the cramped space, and they clashed with Erika. The impact pushed her controls, sending the pod flying in an upwards spiral, and making them lose balance.

Erika looked over to the Archive once more, just in time to see Lizah arrive to the doors. The Enforcers posted there tried to stop her, but she somehow shrugged their riot guns off and charged towards them. Erika had just enough time to see them crushed against the walls of the Archive before the thing leapt onto her.

She tried to get her sword, but the space was too cramped. She couldn’t get inside her coat. *Damn! Fucking knew it!* Olin grabbed the vessel and tried to wrench it out of Erika, but it just wouldn’t let go. She was scrambling, looking for something to hold on to… and she found the controls of the pod. She pulled from the steer, and the craft shook violently, sending the thing overboard and them spiralling on a collission course straight for the nearest tower.

# Crash and Burn

Vanya and her attacker tumbled off the roof of the tower. They rolled down the steep tiled incline, punching and kicking with each tumble. Amidst the flurry of hits, the Enforcer was able to see her attacker. It was Dominick, or what was left of him. His face had the same rictus of rage as the other infected as he reached for her throat.

Vanya could feel the tiles crack as they sent each other flying, both trying desperately to place themselves on top of the other. She had to get a grip somewhere. If she didn’t, she would roll off the roof of the Archive and squash herself in the pavement.

Powered by murderous fury, Dominick was strong. But Vanya was quick. She saw the pattern in the thing’s attacks, and she prepared mentally. When Dominick lunged towards her, Vanya didn’t try to resist. Instead, she flattened her back against the tiles, allowing Dominick’s body to fly over her. As he passed over, Vanya raised planted one of her feet on Dominick’s belly, and grabbed his wrists.

“I’m sorry, boy.” She said, and she pressed the roof with the other foot, using it as leverage to push her opponent’s body off the tower.

With a snarl, the monster extended his fingers, reaching for her neck. It wasn’t enough. The momentum carried him forward and off the slippery surface, falling hundreds of meters towards the crowd, and the body of the boy that had been Dominick was gone.

Vanya was still on her back, sliding head first into the abyss. She reached around with her fingers, desperately trying to find perching. She found a crack in one of the tiles, and wrapped her hand around it. She felt a painful tug in her arm as her body came to a sudden halt, but she held on.

Looking down, it was chaos. The bridge was cut, sending thousands to their deaths. The vessels had overrun the walk to the Archive, and were now leaping between the hovering boxes in a frenzy.

She saw some figures enter the Archive, and she spotted Trygon entering right behind them. She also saw one of the boxes flying, directly towards her. One of the vessels was hanging off the side, and Erika and Olin were inside, trying to regain control. The monster had somehow climbed onto the box’s railguard, and was about to leap onto Erika.

If she didn’t do something, the monster would get them. Still in her precarious position, Vanya took out her stubber gun with her free hand, and aimed. It wouldn’t kill it, but it may distract it long enough.

---

“Watch out!” Olin screamed as Erika was finally taking hold of the controls. She turned, just in time to see the beast dive towards her. As it rose in the air, Erika knew she wouldn’t have time to react.

A loud bang sounded from the side, and the thing changed direction mid-air. It tumbled to the right, unable to grab hold of anything, and it fell to the void below.

“You’re welcome” Vanya’s voice sounded through the commlink.

“It’s about time.” Erika answered “Where were you?”

"Busy. On your left."

Erika looked, and she saw the Enforcer, hanging precariously from a broken tile, smoking gun in hand.

“Don’t move, we’ll get you.”

“Wasn’t planning to.”

Erika directed the box towards Vanya, and she leapt inside.

“What happened?” Erika asked.

“Dominick. He got snatched too.” The Enforcer answered curtly.

Erika remembered the boy’s face. Another life on Lizah’s ledger.

“She made it in.” Erika continued. “And they barred the doors”

“Yeah, I know. But I saw Trygon go in after her. He’ll get her.”

Erika was relieved to hear that. At the very least, that would buy them some time. She looked down. Most of the booths — the ones that remained, anyway — had moved up, out of reach of the beasts.

With nobody left to kill, the remaining vessels were making their way to the facade of the Archive. The doors were closed, and periodic bursts of fire from the posted Enforcers took a few down each time, but there were already a few vessels climbing the building towards them.

“They won’t last too much longer.” Erika said. “We need to help them.”

“Take me to my gear,” The Enforcer said, pointing to the top of the tower. “We’ll take some of them with us at least.”

Erika tugged from the controls, directing it upwards. They had just made it to Vanya’s sniper nest when the world exploded.

A deafening boom burst from the Archive, blowing up the stained glass windows in a shower of green, red and gold. The blast threw monsters and Enforcers off-balance, making many of them drop to their deaths in the pavement.

"That’s them." Erika said. "Trygon and Lizah. They’re fighting." There was something very concerning. "And Trygon is losing."

Vanya looked at her, alarmed “How do you know that?”

“Look at them.” Erika signalled the vessels. They had gotten up again, and were climbing the Archive. “They’re still moving.”

“Fuck…” Was all Vanya could muster. She looked, horrified, as the first ones reached the agents and plucked them from their nests with ease.

"We need to go in." Said Erika. "Here, through the window. There’s only one way we stop this."

“But you saw what Lizah can do, didn’t you? It’s suicide.” Vanya's voice cracked for a split second, betraying distress.

Erika looked at Vanya, straight in the eyes. "You got any better ideas, Enforcer?" Erika knew the right buttons to press to motivate soldiers "Got any better ideas? You swore an oath to protect these people. This is the way we protect them."

That had the effect that Erika wanted. Vanya’s sight focused again. She looked at the massacre going on below her one last time, and she nodded gravely. Then she returned Erika’s determined look “I’m with you.”

“Good. Olin, take the controls. Take us to that blown rosette window, and stand by.”

Olin nodded, but Erika could see pain in his eyes. He wasn’t ready to fight yet, but it saddened him to stay out of the action.

As Olin took them closer to the rosette, Erika removed her coat. Underneath, the simple shirt was a lot easier to move in. She checked her gun and cane one last time, and looked at Vanya, then Tristan.

She said “Let’s go,” and jumped through the window.

# Lizah

The broken rosette gave way to a plascrete passageway, probably reserved for maintenance crews. Erika crouched as soon as she landed, and she prompted Vanya to do the same. Tristan followed them short after.

From there, they had an overview of the Archive lobby. The big open space, once lined with counters full of useful guiding servos, now stood barren, awaiting the influx of vessels that would never come.

The room culminated in a large staircase, which normally directed visitors to the upper levels. Now, it was crowned by the biggest Cognitor Erika had seen. This was the Input Node, the only Cognitor that could write into the Archive’s databanks. The interim Master Archiver was beside it, shaking.

At the foot of the staircase, the view was less magnificent. They saw Lizah’s figure, now with her hood down, hovering over a man, sprawled face down on the ground. It was missing an arm, and blood was pooling under him. Around the man, five black hoods were floating in pools of blood and gore.

“Trygon…” Erika whispered. She was right, he had lost.

She advanced, and signalled Vanya to follow. The passageway was hovering along the edges of the Archive walls, suspended tens of meters above the floor by steel cables. As they advanced, the platform swung lightly with their shifting weight. Carefully, they came closer to Lizah’s position.

“… over, Inspector.” They heard Kyriel’s wet, gurgly voice say from Lizah’s gaping mouth. “It was a good try, I admit. You are well-versed in the daemonic… for a human. Such a waste, that it had to end like this. Are you sure you don’t prefer to join the winning side?”

The Inspector didn’t move, but a flicker of yellow light gathered around his hand. He pointed a finger at Lizah, and an amber ray of dancing lightning shot towards her. Even from the distance, Erika could see the air boil around the powerful blast.

Lizah swatted it out of the way, almost as an afterthought.

“Oh well.” Kyriel said, as the ray impacted a section of wall near Erika’s position. The blast blew a hole in the rockrete walls, spraying dust and debris everywhere. The platform shook with the shockwave, and Erika almost lost balance. “I guess you’ll bleed out then.”

*That power…* she thought, looking at the smoldering hole in the wall. *And she shrugged it off like it was nothing. How are we going to do this?*

Lizah turned towards the surrogate Archiver. “Now, dear Ipsimus. Have you had time to reconsider my offer? It’s a pity you didn’t want to see like the other Acolytes, but you can still be useful to me.”

The man was shaking with terror. “Y-yes, Lizah.” He said, before falling to his knees and covering his head with his hands, sobbing.

“Now, now, Ipsimus.” Kyriel said. “Now is not the time for crying. I need you to unlock the Cognitor, remember?”

Erika turned to Vanya. “That’s our chance. She can’t hear us when she’s distracted with the Cognitor. That’s when we go in.” Erika looked at Vanya’s carbine “Cover me from range, I’ll go down.” The Enforcer nodded, and prepared the carbine.

As Lizah stepped into the padded armchair of the Input Node and donned the helmet, Erika and Tristan made their way to the ground floor, using a staircase at the end of the platform. The servos on her exoskeleton whirred as she stepped down, and Erika hoped they wouldn’t be heard.

But they were. Lizah’s senses were already impaired by their connection with the Congitor, but Ipsimus heard her approach. Erika pressed a finger to her lips, praying that the new Archiver had grown a spine.

Erika heard Kyriel say “Activate it *now*, Ipsimus. Hurry.”

Erika was getting close, she could almost reach out for Lizah. She unsheathed her sword, and turned it on. The blade shone with dancing sparks of energy.

The Archiver’s hands shook as he tried to insert a key into the Congitor’s control terminal. He tried a few times, but each time his hands failed to find the hole.

“Oh, gods!” Kyriel exclaimed, exhasperated. “Give me the key, I’ll do it myself.” Lizah reached out, and grabbed the key from the Archiver’s hands. The moment she touched his hands, her movement stopped. Then, she smiled. “Erika! Welcome.”

*Damn! She must have seen it in the Archiver’s mind.* It was now or never. Erika lunged forward, her sword pointed directly at Lizah’s heart. She got her. No matter if Lizah knew, Erika was going to end this here and now. The tip of her sword burnt a hole in Lizah’s robe. For a second, Erika saw victory.

But only for a second.

Purple light burst from Lizah’s body, and Erika was thrown across the room. She tumbled down the stairs, rolling one, two, three… six times, finally stopping near the pool of liquid that was once a vessel.

Erika tasted blood in her mouth. She tried to stand, but the servos in her leg complained loudly, eventually refusing to move. The crash had snapped the supports on her leg, and she felt immense pain as she tried to stand on the broken bone.

Behind, Lizah had gotten up from the Congitor, and was coming towards her.

“Erika, Erika. You don’t give up, do you?” Kyriel gurgled. Erika could feel the rasping crackles of static that emanated from Lizah’s body. “I would have sworn I’d killed you last time, but I guess nobody’s perfect. I’ll make sure to do it right this time.”

Her mind swimming in pain, Erika managed to straighten herself. She ignored the searing pain in her leg as she readied her sword for another attack.

“There’s something admirable in your determination, I guess.” As she said that, Lizah raised a hand, and a burst of searing purple energy shot from it. Erika rolled to one side, screaming with pain as her leg faltered, and she was forced to her knees. The ray struck the pool of blood, instantly evaporating the liquid, and the floor below it. It had missed by a hair's breadth.

“Good move!” Shouted Kyriel. “But can you do it again?” Feeling her mind go numb with pain, Erika wasn’t sure she could. But she still had an ace in the hole.

Lizah prepared another blast, and fired. As the purple light left her hand, they heard the whistle of a las-round shoot from the rafters, and hitting Lizah square in the face. The ray went wide as the former Archiver covered the smoldering side of her head.

Erika screamed “Now, Tristan!” And she lunged forward with a single, desperate leap. The cat leapt from his hiding place, grabbing one of Lizah’s hands. Erika directed her blade at her heart, but she was pushed back once more. Lizah wailed with pain, a deafening scream that made Erika drop and cover her ears.

When her former friend looked at her again, half of her face was gone. The las-round had been true, it had blown off the left half of Lizah’s head. But she was still moving. The hole in her face wasn’t bleeding… at least not blood. A shimmering, violet slime was slowly pouring out of the grotesque wound, running down Lizah’s neck. As it dripped onto the floor, the liquid started eating away at the marble, opening dozens of tiny smoking holes.

Lizah’s face was a grimace of pain. She screamed again, and released a stream of energy towards Vanya’s position. This wasn’t the short burst Erika had seen before. This was a rage-fueled river of deadly force, directed straight at the Enforcer. Lizah’s wail continued for several seconds while she blew the platform apart, tearing deep gushes into the Archive’s walls.

Knelt on the floor, hands over her ears to ameliorate the agony of Lizah’s voice, Erika hoped Vanya had had the sense to move quickly.

Eventually, Lizah turned to Erika. She was panting. The shot hadn’t killed her, but she looked hurt.

“Now…” Kyriel and Lizah said in unison, between breaths “you!” With that last word, another stream of energy flew towards Erika.

Erika tried to dodge, but her body wasn’t responding anymore. She saw her fate coming towards her.

But it never arrived.

A voice somewhere screamed “Fire!”, and a rain of red and green sprang from the walls of the archive. Hundreds, thousands of las-fire and solid rounds, all aimed towards Lizah. The Archiver wailed again at the assault, and it stopped the blast that was going to kill Erika.

Belcroft looked around. Rien had made it, in the end. Constanza’s gang was surrounding the Archive lobby, placed on the platforms, the stairs and the holes in the wall. They had come, and they were all shooting at Lizah.

In the center of the room, Lizah grunted with rage as the scorching fire hit her. For a moment, it looked like she was going down, but she managed to raise her head and looked at Erika. Lizah’s body started convulsing as Kyriel cackled “You think this will kill me?”

Suddenly, Erika felt a power surge within her. The pain that had flooded her mind was gone, and she could think clearly. She got up, and raised her sword. It felt stronger. More… powerful. She looked around, and saw Trygon pointing a wavering finger at her. Somehow, she knew what she had to do.

When she saw this, Lizah’s body convulsed with laugther “You think you can kill me? You’ve tried, remember! Even if they destroy this body, I’ll still be here! I live in your greed. I feed on your ambitions. I flourish on your discord. As long as conflicts exists, I’ll be there.” The cackle stopped, and Kyriel’s resonating voice made the Archive’s walls shake “I am eternal.”

Fueled by revenge, rage and this new energy, Erika lunged forward with all her might. This time, her blade found its prey. With a clean, slashing sound, the energized metal seared through fabric and bone, lodging itself in the former Archiver's flesh.

Lizah’s body, now hovering inert in the air, started convulsing. The the ichor that was supurating from her wounds started shining brighter, and everyone in the room felt the energy pile up.

Erika felt her new power leaving her, and her legs gave out again. As she dropped to her knees, she heard Rien’s voice behind her

“Get away! She’s going to blow!”

Erika couldn’t move, every ounce of energy spent. She breathed deep, waiting for the blast to take her. It was done. Lizah was dead, and Kyriel was gone with her. The people of Decorat would be free again. Surprised, she realized that she was happy to give her life for them.

Erika closed her eyes, and smiled. A second later, she felt a big force push her backwards, and she lost consciousness.

# Ashes

*Caffeine.*

This was the first thought in Erika’s mind as she came back. She didn’t know where she was, but she was lying down, with her eyes closed. Her whole body felt stiff and numb. Wherever she was, the smell of fresh caffeine filled the air like a warm embrace.

She didn’t even try to move for a few moments, and instead let the warmth of the delicious aroma spread from her nose to her throat, eventually reaching her chest.

*Slightly acidic,* she realized, as she discovered the different notes of the brew. W*arm, with a hint of spice. Organic crop, probably raised in high altitude.*

“She’s awake!” Rien’s voice broke her out of the moment. Reluctantly, Erika opened her eyes.

“See, Olin?” Rien asked, turning to the door. “I told you caffeine would wake her up!”

The morning light filtering trough courtains was blinding, at first. Erika’s eye adjusted after a few seconds, and she saw her room’s ceiling. Between that ceiling and her face, though, Rien’s grinning head was looking at her intently.

“That you did, young man” Olin’s voice sounded from outside Erika’s field of vision. She couldn’t see him, but just by the tone Erika could picture, with fantastic clarity, the smile of patience in the old butler’s face.

“Wh-” She tried to speak, but ended up coughing violently instead. She felt something wet in her mouth.

“Don’t force yourself, Miss Belcroft” Rien said, as he produced a napkin and tapped it against her lips. “You need to rest” When he pulled the napkin back to store it, Erika saw spots of blood staining it.

“Here, let me” Rien said, and he reached somewhere below Erika. There was a quiet click, and motors whirred as the bed raised Erika into a seating position. As she rose, Erika felt a sharp pain in her midsection, and grimaced.

Rien noticed “Oh, sorry, sorry!” He said, as he stopped the bed. Erika looked at the boy, and he lowered his gaze.

From her upright position, Erika could see the whole room now. The courtains were waving, dancing with the fresh air of an early morning. Tristan was curled up beside her, snoring. Olin was waiting at the doorframe, holding a tray with a cup. Erika reached out to pet Tristan, and grunted loudly when she realized that her whole body felt like a mag-train had passed over her.

“I wouldn’t advise that, mamzel” Olin said, stepping closer. Erika ignored him, and finally reached Tristan. The cat purred as she ran her fingers through his shiny fur. Erika felt Olin’s eyes roll.

“C-caffeine, O-olin” She said. Her throat felt dry and full of mucus at the same time, but she managed to speak without coughing too much.

“Of course, mamzel.”

Erika reached out with her free hand, sourly discovering that it was every bit as painful. Nevertheless, she took the cup to her lips, and sipped.

The warmth she had felt with the aroma multiplied when she tasted the brew. It was very good, with a full body and a pleasant mouthfeel. No unpleasant bitterness, and just the right amount of fruity notes.

“O-olin, you brewed this yourself, d-didn’t you?” She asked. “It's fantastic.”

Olin beamed a smile, “I’m happy to hear that. It’s from the mountain ranges of Karst. Your father ordered the shipment a few years ago, and it arrived right before the Rites. The boy thought you might enjoy it.”

Rien’s gaze was still low.

Olin continued “He’s been visiting you every day, you know?”

“Is that right?” Erika looked at Rien, and the boy blushed slightly. She looked back at Olin, and they both smiled. Rien’s gazel jumped from one to the other, not understanding.

“The Rites*…"* Erika remembered.”What happened?"

“I can probably answer that” Said a voice from the hallway. The crouching figure of Inspector Ozmund Trygon limped through the door. “It’s a pleasure to see you awake, mamzel. You look terrible though, I must say.”

Erika smiled. “That’s the h-harshest thing you’ve said to date, Inspector. You don’t look to well either.” He truly didn’t. His right arm was missing, its hollow sleeve strapped to the waist of his simple robes. He had a cane on the other hand, which he used to take dubitative steps towards Erika’s bed. His face was the worst part, though. His eyes had visibly receded into their sockets, and his skin had thinned considerably, making him look almost dead.

“I suppose I don’t.” He said, but he smiled back regardless. “We did it, mamzel Belcroft. Or, rather, *you* did it. Your final strike put an end to that monster your friend had become. Though powerful, the memory of the beast Kyriel died with Lizah.”

“It wasn’t j-just me though, was it?” Erika asked. She remembered the strength she had felt right before plunging her sword into Lizah’s heart.

“No, it was not. I must admit, I did provide some assistance. You provided the steel, the courage and the strength. I merely provided the edge, so that your  edge peforated Kyriel’s power as well as Lizah’s flesh.”

Erika pondered on Trygon’s words for a moment. “You and I are going to have a chat sometime, Inspector, and you’ll explain what this…” She hesitated to use the word “… *magic* is all about.”

“We will, mamzel, in due time. In fact, that is why I am still here. I have an offer to make you.”

“Later” Erika said. She had an inkling of what it was, and she was in no state to consider it. Besides, she still had questions. She remembered Vanya Minsk, and the shot that had saved her life. “What about Enforcer Minsk? Did she make it?”

“Ah.” Said the Inspector. A shadow passed over his gaze, and Erika feared the worst. “That is… still to be seen. From what we can gather, she managed to avoid the brunt of the blast, but most of her body received serious burns anyway. She is currently under intensive care, but our medics cannot be certain of any outcome. In some sense, it’s in her hands now.”

“But what about my sister?” Rien asked, suddenly worried by this news. “Vanya said that she would make sure my sister didn’t go to the freezer. All the others, too! Is she going to be okay?”

The Inspector smiled benevolently “Yes, young Vessir. Now that the main host of Kyriel is destroyed, everyone infected should return to normal,” He hesitated for a bit, then added “with time. In the meantime, the Empire will provide aid to those affected.” He turned to Erika “Kyriel wasn’t the only thing wrong with Decorat, I’ve found. After my report, the Empire will take a much more active role in the administration of the city. To start, we will rebuild the districts affected by the incident. It’s due time we kept close tabs on Sagitar's operations.”

Erika nodded, wincing as she felt the bruise on her neck.

“One last question, Inspector. You were there. How did I survive? I felt the full force of the blast. I should be dead.”

The Inspector chuckled, lightly. “That’s not a question you should be asking *me*, mamzel Belcroft.” He looked sidweways at Rien, as did everyone in the room.

The boy's cheeks caught fire. “Well, I… I saw that it was going to blow… and you weren’t getting up! I had to do *something!* So I ran, and pushed you out of the direct blast. You still got hit, though.”

Erika didn’t say a word, but she kept looking at Rien with a straight face.

Olin broke the silence. “For once, his foolishness paid off, mamzel” He said, with a chuckle.

Erika kept her searing gaze on Rien “For once, yes. Don’t make it a habit, boy.”

Rien’s blush intensified “No, I wouldn’t —”

He was interrupted by Erika’s laughter. Rien looked around, confused for a moment, then started laughing as well.

Erika’s laugh was cut short by a sharp cough, a painful reminder that she was still badly hurt.

“I think it will be better if I rest for a bit” She said, to the gathered people. As they turned to leave, she added “Leave the cup, though, Olin”

---

With everyone gone, Erika enjoyed the caffeine’s aroma once more.

She looked from the window. She could see the buzz of local grav-trucks transporting people and materials. Decorat had been hurt, but it was safe. The world would rebuild.

*At least something good came from me being here* she thought. She considered the Inspector’s words. *He’s probably going to ask me to join the Inspectorate.* And, truth be told, she was tempted. She had seen the good they could do. They really fought for humanity. They really saved lives. And she realized, somewhat surprisingly, that a part of her was starting to like that more than any of her former achievements in the military.

With one hand running through Tristan’s fur, she took another sip from the cup, still as delicious as the first. She remembered her father. Jordan Belcroft had always had good taste.

“I will miss you.” She said, to nobody in particular.

# Epilogue

Celeste Vessir joined the crowd in cheering as the new recruits approached the stage.

The young Decoratians marched in single file into the raised platform. Most of the recruits bore a serious look, and they didn’t even bother looking into the crowd. In the Academy grounds, above the Archive, the sun shone directly on them, making the gold and red buttons on their mess uniforms shine with a blinding glare.

Cel squinted, scanning the crowd. She could almost see… yes, there he was! Rien, her little brother, looking uncomfortable in his new Academy uniform.

She waved vigorously. Rien looked at her, blushed, and for a moment pretended he didn’t know her. She kept waving, and eventually Rien smiled weakly and returned the wave, which invited side-glances from the recruits at his sides.

When all the recruits had made it into the stage, they all snapped to attention, and saluted the gathered crowd. It was all very official, very fancy. Cel wasn’t used to it, but she didn’t really care.

Through Miss Belcroft’s recommendation, Rien had been awarded entry. Not only that, they had given him a very generous scolarship to cover his living expenses. Cel had never seen that much money together before.

On the stage, an old man walked up to the vox augmentor, and started reciting in a monotone voice.

“Fellow Decoratians.” His voice vibrated through the air “Thank you for attending this momentous ocasion. I wouldn’t want to continue without thanking our generous patrons, that have once more made great strides to ensure the continued and prolonged existence of our very dear institution. The Academy is made…”

As the man’s speech drifted into a long list of names, Cel’s thoughts drifted away from it.

She took a deep breath, savouring the fresh air of the higher levels. As the gusts of wind danced on her skin, she realized she had missed the feeling of cool breezes.

She also realized she had missed pretty much every feeling for a while. She remembered her nightmares, just a short months back. That voice, that… Kyriel. They were everywhere… *it* was everywhere. Whispering, suggesting, threatening. Even now, thinking about it made her shiver.

She had plunged into that hell for months. Resisting, trying to keep a semblance of herself. Always tired, but never being able to rest. In the end, she was feeling more dead than alive with exhaustion. She didn’t want to think what would have happened to her without Rien’s help.

*But now it’s gone*, she told herself as she raised her head. *I don’t want to think about it.*

“… as we leave behind these trying times, and look forward to the future’s plentiful bounty…” The old man was still at it.

Cel spotted Rien again, and she felt a wave of pride. If it hadn’t been for him, she would be in a freezer right now. After Kyriel was gone and everyone started waking up, they had told her how Rien, her little Rien, had helped bring that monster down.

*You’re a hero, bro. I know you still don’t feel like it, but you are. And now, you’ll get the chance you always deserved.*

She tried her hardest to focus on the ceremony, and she realized that the old man was about to be finished.

“… thank you”

She started clapping just in time, with the rest of the crowd. As she was clapping, Cel felt something in the back of her mind. A little sting, like an insect’s bite.

Her blood froze, and she stopped clapping. Celeste stood there, hands raised mid-clap, unable to do anything to stop it.

The sting grew, little by little, inch by inch, until it turned into a voice.

A wet, throaty, gurgling voice.

“Hello, Celeste” it said “Have you missed me?”
