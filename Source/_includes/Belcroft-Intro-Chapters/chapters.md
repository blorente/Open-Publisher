# Prologue

*thump, thump*.

*Thump, Thump*.

*THUMP, THUMP*.

“No!”

The smell of damp laundry filled my nostrils as the hab block shook with the mag-tram passing outside. Heart pumping, I reached blindly across the room for the wedding ring.

“It’s not real. Oh, Vivien, be with me.”, I uttered, breathless as I clutched the tiny piece of metal to my bare chest.

I opened my eyes, trying to bring my breath back to a reasonable pace. The cracks of the window projected on the ceiling, lit up by the passing carriages. I lied on my bed a little longer, letting the dancing lights take my mind away from the nightmare.

This had been the worst one yet.

Eventually, my chest started to slow down. I started noticing my surroundings; the stains of sweat on the sheets, the boots of the upstairs neighbours getting ready for the day, and the metallic smell of blood.

“That’s new.”

I looked down at my hands. I’d been holding on to the ring too hard. It had left a deep cut in the soft skin of my palm. With a grimace of pain, I let go of it.

They were definitely getting worse. I hand’t been able to get a good night’s sleep for ages. Not since my Cognitor reassignment. I didn’t know how many more nights like those I could take.

I swallowed hard, battling that thought. The MILITIA clearance was a sign that the Corporation itself had noticed my diligence and skill. The promotion was good. Besides, they wouldn’t have given me the job if they didn’t think I had the strength to bear any load it carried, would they?

As the last echoes of the nightmare dissipated from my mind, I got up to get ready for work.

---

The warm smell of freshly brewed caffeine quickly filled the room, making the episode a few moments earlier seem like… well… a bad dream. I brought the warm cup to my lips with a bandadged hand as I looked outside the window above the sink.

Above, below, all around me, people were exiting their rockrete hab-blocks and heading down the long staircases, to the mag-train station in Level 80, East Quadrant. They were heading upcity, most of them to work in the Grand Archive in some capacity. I would be joining them soon enough.

As I continued sipping my drink, the 08:90 train made its way to the station. That was my cue. I started getting dressed.

---

“Faustus! You ready mate?” - I heard Jorrick shout outside, his words punctuated by his fists slamming the door.

Of course I was ready. I wouldn’t – *couldn’t*, get to work late. Not now, not serving the Corporation directly.

“Mhm…” - I answered calmly, as the door to my hab slid open.

“About time!”, he smiled. “That caffeine I smell?”. I handed him a plastek cup. “Aha! Cheers.”, he said, taking a big gulp. “Vivian bless you mate!” he said with a wink.

I smiled – despite his sarcasm – feeling the familiar cold of the wedding ring in my hand. I certainly hoped she did. I missed her.

We started down the stairs, making our way to Level 80. The morning chill was greatly nullified by the usual mass of bodies going to the station. Boots were clinking and clanking their way down the zig-zagging metal staircases of the hab-block complex. Thousands of these hard-cold steps covered the facade of The Grids, as the buildings were affectionately known. Still, there was never enough room in rush hour.

Pushing and pulling, twisting and turning, we descended. I could feel the sweat of other people on my skin by the time we reached the station and got on the mag-tram. I’m sure I must have spilled caffeine on someone’s clothes by accident.

“So? How’s the new office?” asked Jorrick with a smirk, as we reached the platform and stopped to catch our breath.

I smiled. A Cognitor was an office as much as the ground levels were a PleaseCog bar.

“You know I can’t talk about it”

“I know, I know. It’s just you’ve been… odd, lately. Not that I’m complaining about the raise” he said, raising the caffeine cup. He smiled, but his eyes betrayed his concern. “I reckon you’ve not got some proper shut-eye in a while.”

“Mhm…”. I sipped as we hurried inside the packed carriage. Jorrick shrugged.

“PLEASE ENSURE THAT ALL EXTREMITIES ARE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE AT ALL *clang*”. The mechanized voice of the speakers got interrupted by a loud snap of the closing doors. With a tug, the mag-train started accelerating towards the spires. I stared at the rows of rockrete hab-blocks, their facades blackened by the ever-present mist of the lower hive.

---

The train was shaking in its suspensions as it rushed through the Medic district. Five long white marble strips, no more than three stories tall, formed the bulk of the hospital complex. They were arranged in a neat circle, all reaching out from a spire of contrasting red stone, some twenty stories tall, and windowless.

“You know? I’ve always found the Fingers surprisingly similar to a Cognitor” I said, turning to Jorrick. I wrangled my arm, trying to bring the cup to my lips through the backs and chests of the surrounding workers filling the space.

“Huh. Yeah, I can see it.” He paused for a bit, as if digesting the epiphany “Bugger! Now not even the nuts will let you get away from the damn things.”

“You do know that most people heal from Pod Disease”. I finally got the cup to my lips, barely spilling anything.

“The voices stop alright, but that ain’t ‘healing’ in my book. Like putting a jackhammer to your head! I reckon they built the Fingers so low so that us poor ninkers won’t die if we jump off. They don’t care about your broken back, if your mind’s still sharp.”

He did have a point. Just like Pod Disease affected everyone differently, it was hard to predict what the resets would do to the workers that ended up in the Fingers.

I looked around the carriage; oddly, nobody seemed to rise an eyebrow at the mention of such a sensitive topic. Had they not heard Jorrick? He certainly had been loud enough.

A couple of urban fliers zoomed past the train, towards one of the Medic buildings. They were painted in Enforcer bronze, shining bright against the red and white backdrop.

That didn’t help Jorrick’s mood. “Bet they’re coming from the Grids, those ninkers.”

I sighed. They probably were, on their way to drop some poor soul. “They are fulfilling their duty, just like you and me.”

“Ha! Cleaning up the mess of the Corporation? Some job that is.”

“Shush! Don’t speak like that!” I was the one shouting now. At the sound of my voice, people lifted their heads, startled.

“It just ain’t right! How long do you think till one of those Pods drives *you* nuts? Talk about the Emperor all you want, but I see what they’re doing to you.”

“Jorrick!” Why were people staring at me? Jorrick was the one shouting heresy!

“I know, I know.” His tone softened, suddenly realizing he had crossed a line. “Just worry about my caffeine supply, is all”.

He raised his cup and smiled, and I sighed and did the same. I looked out the window, and couldn’t help but wonder.

How long indeed?

---

Finally, the mag-tram arrived at its final destination. The crowd started pouring out of the carriage, filling the narrow streets that led to the worker’s entrance of the Grand Archive. After a brief stop to find a bin to dispose of my cup, I took out my ID pass and made my way to the lines forming at the entrance gates.

I looked around, but Jorrick was not there anymore. I hadn’t seen him step off the train either. I shrugged. *Probably lost in the crowd.*

The line of workers shambled forwards, silently slipping into the Grand Archive like rain being swallowed by the gutter. I looked up, shielding my eyes from the sunlight.

The Great Archive was high enough in Decorat to be free of the smog. Its myriad of gothic towers reached into the clear sky. The cold morning light turned vibrant shades of green, red and gold when it reflected in the hundreds of stained glass windows. My favourite, “The Sacrifice of Vassili Oberon”, stood at the tip of the smallest tower.

I touched my signet, closed my eyes, and let the sound of a prayer inundate me with light.

“Vivian, please give me strength to fullfill the duty that I’ve been assigned”.

The story of Vassili Oberon, how he saved the whole Solar Empire by standing in the way of the Derelict general during the Great Expansion, reminds us all that we are all important to the glory of the Empire. That our work and determination will be rewarded.

“Give me courage to face the horrors, and strength to -”

“Move it!” Somebody shoved me forward in the queue. I stumbled, and realized I was already at the gates.

“Sorry, sorry…” I felt the warmth inside of me fade away with the cold stab of the morning chill. I fumbled through my coat, looking for my ID.

Front pockets? No. “Oi! Your Holy Grace! I said move it! I can’t be late again!”

Breast pockets? No. “Sir, you you’re blocking the queue”. A gate guard was waving his arms, signaling me to hurry.

“Yes, just a moment.” I was completely cold now “I can’t find my pass”

“It’s in your hand, sir”. The guard could barely hide a sigh.

“Oh.” I blushed, looked down, and scanned the pass without a word. As soon as the display beeped green, I rushed through the gates.

I had taken less than ten paces from the gates when my hand started feeling strange. Almost as if it was missing something…

“My ring!” I spun towards the gate. My feet tried to run, but the rest of my body couldn’t fight the human tide pouring into the building.

“Let me through, please! I need to get my ring back”. Some people in front of me tried to make way. They were quickly pushed back by the vacant-eyed mass of people that poured relentlessly into the building.

I waved my arms, signalling to the guard that had hurried me before. He was picking something off the ground. When he saw me, he turned his head towards me.

“I’m sorry sir, you’re going to have to come and pick this up later.” The guard put the ring in his pocket.

“No, I need that! I need her –”

“Move along!” He commanded, and turned back to attend the incoming crowd.

My heart was racing, and I felt weak in my knees. I would have fallen down, if there had been a free inch of floor to do so. The thumps of pumping blood were ringing in my ears, just like last night. The burning city. Billions being massacred. The sharp lights of orbital lances sweeping across districts. Chain explosions following a second later. The fire, the screams, the stench of burning flesh. “Oh no, oh Vivian, please -”

“You ’eard ’im, move it!” Two strong hands turned me towards the ascending staircase, and shoved me forward.

I snapped out of it. The smell of smoke lingered, but before me no longer stood the ashen plain. Instead, a great staircase spiralled towards the high ceiling, connecting the different sections of the Grand Archive.

I forced myself to take a step forward. Then another one. Stumbling, I joined the crowd once again, making my way towards Cognitor 36B, Sectio Militia.

I would have to come back for the ring later. I just hoped I would have the strength to get through the day.

---

As I got higher in the spiral staircase, the crowd started thinning. The higher floors of the Grand Archive were limited to the MILITIA clearance levels, where Inspectors and their retinue came to do their research, and the generals and high-level bureaucrats of the future came to study the past.

I inhaled deeply, letting the smell of static banish the last remnants of the battle for the second time this day. I stopped, appreciating the privilege of having such breathing room.

Yes, it was hard work to retrieve and process documents for the Inquisition. Yes, some of those images stuck like memories. But I had been chosen, and I had a duty to fulfill. They wouldn’t have chosen me otherwise. I needed to brave what may come. And besides…

“Vivian is with me”.

The words made my hands a little bit warmer. I clenched my fists, and carried on, up to my station.

---

Cognitor 36B, Sectio Militia was cold that day. Two men in janitor uniforms were cleaning the green carpet surrounding the ten Retriever stations, in preparation for the shift change.

When I got into the room, Archiver Arsenus emmitted a series of electrical buzzes, punctuated by a steam cloud that sprouted from an opening in his red robes, where his mouth would have been. The Archiver had a perfect view of the room from the plinth he was affixed to, and he had the rare custom to greet his Operators at the start of each shift.

“Good morning to you as well, Archiver” I returned the greeting as I walked around the circle of leatherbound armchairs, to station 8.

My station was empty. “Excuse me, do you know what happened to Herc?” I asked the night shift Operator to my right, as she was rising from her armcahair, getting ready to leave.

“Damn ninker never showed up.” She said. Her breath was still irregular from the last dive, her pupils dilated. “He better come back with a good excuse and a bottle of truwine to share. Now if you’ll excuse me, I can’t be here anymore.” Without one more word, she shambled down the room.

The rest of people in my shift were already connected. I sat on my station, readying myself. A chill ran down my spine as the HUD of my helmet lit up. I felt my pulse rise again, and I touched the place where my ring had been moments ago. I grimaced in pain as my fingers brushed the bandages of this morning’s cut.

I managed to coerce my shaky hands to strap the belts and perform final checks. “Vivian is with me. She will give me the strength.” It was going to be a long day.

My display signalled the successful connection, and ten minds prepared to dive into the depths of the Archive. Reading, watching, sifting, trying to find answers to the queries of the Solar Empire.

“WELCOME, RETRIEVERS OF THE ARCHIVE.” Even through the helmet’s vox interface, Artificer Arsenus’s voice was canny, more machine than human.

“THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. YOU ARE THE BEST RETRIEVERS IN DECORAT, FOR WHICH YOU WERE CHOSEN. YOU ARE THE ELITE. MAKE US PROUD.” These words marked the imminent dive. Usually, hearing them made me feel proud to be serving the Empire. Today, they made me taste vomit at the back of my throat.

A cold hand gripped my heart. I wasn’t ready for this, not again. Cannonfire raged in the back of my mind. I closed my eyes until white dots were dancing inside my pupils and gripped the leather of the armrests, trying to make it go away. Trying to prepare for–

“CAPTAIN ARGOLES, UNIT AURORA, THE DISASTER OF BASKET-43. DATE 7.492. FILE PREFIXES 50123 TO 109034” declared Arsenus.

“LET US BEGIN” And we plunged into a sea of data.

I opened a set of recordings. Within nanoseconds, I was seeing the world from the cockpit of a fighter jet, flying over a majestic parade. Millions of souls cheered as the Empire’s finest marched by a newly conquered planet. I started feeling a sense of pride as I watched the impeccable legions of humanity.

It didn’t last long. When we were reaching the crowd, the fighter dived into it, and opened fire. As the automatic guns raked through the crowds, I realized this recording was from a traitor pilot. I felt sick as I spectated first hand the flier’s guns cutting down thousands of civilians, seconds before precipitating to a fiery, sudden death when the Imperium opened fire. No sign of Argoles.

I had to keep searching. My mind jumped from file to file, processing each before moving on to the next one. I found picts of burning buildings, sound recordings of agonizing people, and death rolls that numbered the thousands. But no Argoles.

“Found it!” Said one of the other Operators.

Our minds snapped back into place, and I gasped for air.

“File 89342, it’s a camera feed from his helmet.”

“WELL DONE. THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.” Without a pause, he added “LET US CONTINUE. INSPECTOR HONDURAS, BATTLE OF VITRIAL-9. DATE 8.342, FILE PREFIXES 70997 TO 134299”.

And we sunk, back to fire and blood.

---

By the tenth query, my head was about to explode. Quick breaths drew the smell of blood, coming from the wound in my hand. I must have opened it again by gripping my chair too hard.

My legs were still shaking from the impact of the last explosion. An alien weapon, somewhere in the far reaches of the Empire, splitting some Major Friedrik in half.

“STATION 8, PLEASE REMAIN FOCUSED”

“A moment, please! I just need to catch –”

“LET US CONTINUTE. INSPECTOR DORCAS, —”.

In my confusion, I missed the file coordinates. Desperate, I opened the first recording I found. I was trapped in a box of steel, surrounded by several other people. A horde of alien beasts were charging towards the group. The others opened fire trying, to slow them down. I heard the roar of las-cannons coming from my cage join the cacophony. It wasn’t enough.

The ravenous beasts didnt even need to stop as their long, blade-like claws tore through the people around me. Some of them attacked the box, and their blade-like limbs ringed with the sound of metal on metal: *clang, clang, clang*.

Whatever I was inside of was sturdy, but every attack opnened bigger gaps in its armor. They started surrounding us, burying the viewport in a flurry of steel and blood.

It was too much. I could feel blood rushing to my ears, and I started gasping for breath. Sharp pain enveloped me as I felt my head – my real head – hit violently against my station’s pillow.

My head exploded, and the world went white.

---

I wake up to the echoes of metal claws ringing in my ears. *clang, clang, clang*. As I come to, eyes still closed, I realize it’s a different sound.

*Tap, tap, tap*.

I feel fresh sheets rub against my bruised neck, sending a sharp pain stab at the back of my head.

Fresh sheets.

This isn’t my station.

“Good morning, Faustus” I hear a voice say. The tapping stops for a second.

I try to open my eyes, but only the left one obeys. The right one responds with a sharp stab of pain instead.

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. That’s a nasty bruise you have there.”

My sight finally comes into focus. The well-lit room is empty, except for a single woman sitting on a chair, talking to me. She is dressed in starched Medicae uniform, and is scratching the glossy surface of her dataslate as he scribbles something. *Tap, tap, tap*.

“Wh-Where am I?” My lips feel heavy and dry. I can barely form the words.

“You’re in Unit 498, East Medic. You gave us a good scare this morning”.

At that mention, I see a flash of sharp, bloody metal claws. My heart skips a beat. I take a deep breath, pushing the memory away.

“What’s going to happen to me?” A note of desperation betrays my feigned confidence. I don’t think my bruises are the reason I’m in the Fingers – I suspect she doesn’t, either.

“Well, Faustus, we’re going to make you all better.” The woman’s lips form a practiced smile. Her eyes don’t. “Don’t you worry. Soon, you’ll feel… good as new” *Tap, Tap, Tap*.

I swallow hard. So it *is* a reset. I try to raise my hands, but tight leather bondages bite into my wrists. The woman’s note-taking accelerates as she sees my struggle.

“Please Faustus, try to calm down”.

My head starts spinning, and my heart racing. Those damn taps turn back into resounding claws: *Clang, clang, clang*.

“You can’t do this to me! I just got a promotion! The Empire needs me in the Archive!” I’m seeing flashes of red now. Flying, thick, wet streaks of blood red. My whole body’s shaking, trying to get out of this damn bed.

She shrugs, putting the dataslate down. “Have it your way.” The smile gone from her lips. The tapping has stopped, but the damage is done. I can barely hear her footsteps approaching through the sounds of battle, but I do feel her hand touching a control beside my head.

Immediately, my body goes numb, and my eyes feel heavy. The blood washes away from my sight, like the the rain wiping off the windows of a train.

“Now, go to sleep”

As I submerge in a pool of nothingness, I hear the woman’s footsteps going away. The door slams shut, leaving me alone in the room.

“Prepare worker FA-X16S for reset” She’s talking to someone outside. I can barely hear her.

“Again, ma’am? Less than a year after the last one? The odds of recovery are –”

“He’s critical. We don’t want another case like that monster Jorrick.” The woman pauses, and I hear the tapping sound again. Through the haze of the sedatives, The name *Jorrick* sounds familiar.

“Oh, would you look at that! According to the file, he and the patient were friends before the man finally snapped and did a number on The Grids. Had to put him in the freezer. Now, we don’t want another one of those, do we?”

“Of course not, ma’am.”

“Well then get to it. Not like he’ll be missed.”

As the footseps fade away into the corridor, the room goes dark.

From a corner of the empty room, I hear Jorrick’s voice.

“Guess you didn’t have that long after all, mate.”

# Planetfall

She elbowed her way out of the personnel carrier.

All things considered, she decided she didn’t want to be there. She was annoyed that they'd made her come bacl. No, not just annoyed. Furious.

Coming back to her home world, four decades later, was good. Great, even. She was looking forward to telling Olin and her father all about the expansion mission. What wasn’t good, however, was leaving the campaign months before getting her promotion to Captain.

Just a week before the damn communique had arrived, she had managed to get her achievents in front of the right people, just as a position opened. It would take her years, if not decades, to build her reputation back up.

Erika Belcroft sighed heavily, straightened her military fatigues, and looked around. Decorat’s starport was largely the same it had been when she left, early in her twenties. Unlike then, though, the lobbies were now packed, and the queues full.

*That’s exactly the welcome you want after a month cooped up in a commercial carrier*, Erika thought, as she pushed through the hundreds of bodies that clogged the exit gates of Terminal 5. *A warm, sticky, sweaty welcome.* She was starting to regret not splurging on a private transport.

She felt Tristan rub against her leg. He had probably noticed her disgust, as he always did. As soon as she found a spot of unoccupied floor, she knelt down and pet her companion cat. He purred, and rubbed his head against her hand. That made Erika feel a little better.

“You always know what to say, friend” Erika said. “Still, it’ll be easier if we’re together. Up!”

Erika tapped her shoulder, and Tristan’s mechanical legs whirred as he jumped to perch on her shoulder. They locked in place, latching to the mechanical harness that Erika was wearing of over her right shoulder and belt.

Above the bustle of people, the glass dome of the starport gave way to a dark void of nothingness. Seeing the pitch black sky, Erika missed the stars. Expansion missions often took her to small colonies, where humanity had only begun to settle. Here, in the millenary world of Decorat, the light belched out of billions of homes drowned the night sky.

Her thoughts were brusquely interrupted. Somebody accidentally shoved her when passing by, forcing Erika to come back to reality, ready to retaliate against whoever had had the audacity. Instead, she saw something surprising.

Usually, most people poured straight into the mag-tram stations that would take them to the lower levels of the city. Wealthy individuals would go up to the flier platform, to get an aircab or rent a gravcar. Wherever it was, people were always *moving* in the starport.

Right now, however, people were standing still. The crowd had frozen in place, forming a circle around something. Dozens, hundreds of people all watching whatever was going on in the small area in its center.

Erika blinked, and her augmetic right eye zoomed into the crowd. Whatever was holding their attention, it was also standing between her and a much deserved bath.

Another zoom revealed a man, alone, in the middle of the opening, shouting in the face of anyone who dared come close.

She looked around. No Enforcers in sight. She sighed. She’d have to do something about it herself.

Thinking of the hot bath and cup of caffeine that were waiting for her at home, she elbowed her way in through the hurricane of plastic clothes and sweaty flesh.

“Sir, in the name of the Solar Empire, I’m going to need you to calm down and shut up.” She said, as she popped out of the wall of pedestrians somewhat, less graciously than she would have liked.

“Foolish girl! They’re coming!” said the man. Erika felt the crowd retract behind her as the man stomped towards her.

*Heh,* She thought, *It’s been a while since somebody called me “girl”.*

As the man got within an inch of her face, Erika noticed his eyes. He was so close Erika could smell the cheap liquor in his breath, but he wasn’t looking _at_ her. He was looking _past_ her, as if staring into the horizon. Despite that, Erika lowered her left hand to grip the hilt of the power estoc hidden in her cane. _Just in case._

“Sir, I’m asking you nicely. Please calm down, and step away”. Given the situation, she didn’t have too much hope, but she had to make it look like she was trying.

“Czokron! Scerzhond! Zhamnuz! Kyriel! Kyriel! It’s coming! I’ve seen it! You will all fall, only their true servants will thrive! You’ll see them and despair!”

At “despair”, a drip of wet gooey spit propelled out of the man’s mouth, landing squarely on Erika’s cheek.

*Alright, that does it.* The man didn’t even have time to react.

She struck with her cane. A short, dry, calculated hit to the man’s diaphragm.  He gasped for air, and doubled over in pain. Before he could process what had just happened, a quick sidestep and a trained punch to the back of the head finished the job. The man was unconscious before he touched the ground.

Erika took out the handkerchief from her stormcoat, wiped the man’s snot from her cheek, and pet Tristan. “We’ll be home soon, dear”.

“FREEZE!”

Erika — and the rest of the crowd — looked up. Bright spotlights pierced the night, lighting Erika and the fallen man. They were shortly followed by two Enforcer fliers making their way down to the scene.

*It’s about time.* Erika thought. The crowd started dispersing with a distinct sense of urgency. Enforcers from the Solar Empire did that to people. She sighed, and raised her hands. She didn’t like to be kept waiting.

By the time the fliers had made it to ground, Erika, Tristan and the sprawled man were the only souls left. The polished steel doors opened with a hiss of steam, and two figures stepped out of the vehicles.

“What’s going on here?” said the first Enforcer. Their voice denoted her as a young woman, though it was hard to distinguish through her uniform’s breastplate and black visor. She was pointing her stub gun towards Erika, and was followed by another, taller figure, holding a riot gun.

“Just doing your job, agent.” Erika replied, hands still up. “I am Erika. _Belcroft_. This man was spewing nonsense and instilling disorder.” Erika lowered her head, directing the agent’s eyes towards the house insignia etched on the breastpocket of her shirt. “May I show you my identification?”

The agent nodded, and Erika handed the guard her ID card.

The officer started reading “Erika Belcroft, —”

“That’s *Major* Erika Belcroft for you, *Enforcer*.” Erika interrupted.

“Right.” Her tone sounded tired. Erika didn’t care. She handed the documents to her partner. “Check the records”. And the tall figure stepped back towards the fliers. She turned to Erika, still pointing her gun towards her – “Now, don’t move. Neither of us wants this to go bad”

“Of course, officer.” Said Erika. Tristan dropped from his perch with a clang, and fixed his eyes on the agent’s visor. “Don’t worry. He's harmless.”

The agent didn’t seem convinced, but opted to keep her gun pointing at Erika.

“ID checks out!” shouted the tall man. The female Enforcer let out a sigh of relief, and her body became visibly relaxed. She holstered her gun and slid her visor up, revealing a tired young face. There was a fierce determination behind the bags in her green eyes.

“We’re going to need you to come with us, for questioning.”

“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Said Erika, lowering her hands and kneeling to pet Tristan. “What’s your name, officer?”

“Vanya Minsk,” Said the officer, “and I’m afraid I must insist, Major Belcroft. This incident falls under an active investigation for the Enforcers, and we need everything we can get.”

*Now, that’s interesting. This is not an isolated incident, then.*

“Enforcer Minsk, I commend your diligence. However, I’m expected at House Belcroft this evening, and I’m _never_ late. You know my name and rank, and therefore you know you probably shouldn’t forcibly arrest me. Furthermore, this is an active investigation, so you can imagine what happened. You know that I didn’t do anything wrong, and I was acting in self-defense.”

_Pause for effect..._

“You’re going to have to let this one go.” Belcroft finished.

Minsk remained impassible, but Erika’s augmetic lens caught her teeth, gritting in frustration.

Erika stopped petting Tristan and stood up, addressing the Enforcer directly. “However, I do not want to stand in the way of our dear Enforcers. So, now that I have your name, I give you my word that I will visit you soon, to provide what aid I can.”

This was the best Minsk was going to get, and they both knew it. Erika could make a lot more trouble for Minsk that this case ever could. The Enforcer sighed, defeated.

“Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to be on my way.” Said Erika, turning towards the barren street. “Tristan, up!” She took a deep breath, feeling the night’s chill fill her lungs. She could make out the outline of the Grand Archive in the distance, at the other end of the city. Behind it, the Spire pierced the night sky. *Home*, thought Erika.

“See you soon!” She said to Minsk with a cutting tone, who had already started loading the man’s inert body in her flier.

She adjusted her coat around her shoulders, checked her cane and lasgun as force of habit, petted Tristan’s head, now perched on her right shoulder, and started walking down the street.

*It’s good to be back,* she thought, *but let’s see about that bath.*

---

A few minutes later, Erika was snatching the keys to the grav-car from the rental company's clerk. She uttered a dismissive "Thank you" and stomped towards the helipad, where all the rental vehicles were resting. The air was ever so slightly cleaner up there, ten floors up and away from the smog. Erika took a deep breath. She couldn’t wait to get home.

Guided by the tracker in the keychain, she found the car. A pristine two-seat Molotch, Series M. Expensive, but she would take every comfort she could get right now. As soon as she opened the doors, two things happened.

First, Tristan leapt into the car, with marked disregard for the new plas-leather covering the seats. His sharp, metallic claws tore deep gashes in the driver’s seat. At the same time, and more alarmingly, Erika heard somebody shout at her.

“Oi! Lady!”

The voice was… young. A boy, probably not more than fifteen. She could swear she heard him gulp as she turned to face him.

"_What._" She said, with all the fury of someone who’s had a really bad day. After a really bad month.

“I-… I’m sorry…” After the initial shock, the voice seemed to be regaining confidence “But you really messed up my plan! I was following that guy!”

The figure forward, enough to be lit up by one of the hololamps. Erika saw that the voice belonged to a scrawny kid, dirty and dressed in common Grid overalls. His clothes had holes in a few places, and his skin had the sickly paleness of someone who lives below the smog line. A street rat, one of billions in the civilised worlds managed by the Sagitar Corporation.

Erika had no patience for street rats right now.

“And why do I care?” Her tone conveyed how much she didn’t.

The boy looked confused. He clearly hadn’t thought about that before approaching.

“I... I...” He started. He lowered his gaze to the ground, fists clenched in frustration. "...he was my only hope." He looked about to crash into tears.

Erika didn’t know what he was hoping, or why that crazy man down there was the answer, and she definitely didn’t want to find out. She didn’t have ill will towards the boy. She just couldn’t be made to bother with anyone’s problems right now.

“Look, boy. I really don’t know what you were looking for and, to be honest, I don’t care. I didn’t mean to cause you harm, but I really must get going. Here, take this for your trouble.”

She handed him the change she had gotten from the grav-car rental place. The boy looked at her, eyes on fire with pain and disgust. He visibly clenched his jaw, but he took the money regardless. He turned and ran away without saying a word.

Erika stood there, watching him leave. After a few seconds, she sighed, got into the car, pet Tristan — who was now curled in the passenger seat — and pushed the event from her memory. It was time to go back home, and finally take that bath.

---

The propulsion engines of the grav-car started with a low hum, lifting Erika and Tristan up into the relatively empty airways. She set the course for Belcroft Manor, engaged the autopilot, and sank into the soft plas-leather cushions. She contemplated the city below her.

The capital city of a world with the same name, Decorat was a hive of contrast. It had been built — or, more precisely, it had grown — around a single building; The Grand Archive, which sat upon the only remaining hill in a planet battered by terraforming industry.

It was one of the most important repositories of knowledge for the Solar Empire, as it stored knowledge predating even the Great Expansion. The Sagitar Corporation realized the importance of that building for the Empire, and made it its business to pursue every profitable opportunity around it.

Over the centuries, the Corporation had engulfed the city, and now everything bore its six-point insignia. From the great supply transports that fed the city’s insatiable hunger, to the small businesses that sold semi-legal goods in the lower levels — everyone depended on Sagitar Corp.

*They have somehow gotten bigger*, Erika thought, as her flier passed one of the distribution centers in the smog. *Somehow, among this muck, they keep finding people to sell stuff to.*

The smog was the colloquial name that Decoratians used to refer to the area below the Grand Archive. The cooling process for the vast ocean of live datablocks that lived below the Archive had been expelling exhaust gasses for millenia. That, coupled with centuries of boundless industrialism, had polluted the atmosphere of Decorat, creating a thick, heavy, almost visible layer of smog that covered the vast towers of hab-blocks where most of the Decoratian population lived. Lung cancer was the first cause of death in the city which, incidentally, had netted Sagitar incredible profits in the pharmaceutical business.

Erika was very glad to be above the smog. She was starting to relax, and as her flier drifted above the stacked prefab blocks, she thought about her reason for coming back. She remembered the official Sagitar communication:

“Sagitar requires your immediate presence in Decorat, for an urgent matter pertaining your father.”

It was remarkably sparse, but it was also signed by Boris Markov, the Chief System Officer himself. One couldn't just reject his calls.

She still didn’t know what to believe. Surely, the Sagitar wouldn’t pull an officer from the frontlines for a light matter, but what could her father have done?

She was pondering these thoughts as the flier approached the center of the city. She could almost make out the shapes of the hillside. Progressively, the bigger buildings became clearer and clearer; the on-world Sagitar HQ, the Solar Empire Enforcer Bureau, the spire where high-ranking chancellors of Sagitar lived, and even the Grand Archive itself, with its old, gothic-pattern towers reaching to the skies.

Tristan purred beside her.

“We’ll be there soon, dear” Erika said, both to the cat and to herself.

As if it had listened to her, the smaller manors of rich families became visible on the hillside.

“There it is,” Said Erika, as she found the three-story house, exactly as she remembered it “Belcroft Manor. Let’s see what this is all about, shall we?”

She smiled, as the flier decelerated to descen into the Manor’s landing pad, in front of the house. THe street hadn't changed a bit in these four decades. She remembered being a child, playing hide and seek with Lizah and the other kids. Somehow. Lizah was the only one she'd eve lost to. Erika was faster, but she would always find a way to outsmart her.

_I may pay her a visit some day._

Maybe being back wasn’t so bad after all.

# Arrival

She landed, releasing a hiss of steam when the doors de-pressurized and opened. A few seconds later, Erika was standing at the gates of House Belcroft. Though small when compared to the biggest houses in Decorat, her family’s seat could comfortably accommodate a hundred guests.

Erika remembered playing with Olin all throughout the manor. Now, an air of abandon painted its facade. Most windows were shut and caked with dust, and the ornate marble stairway leading to the door was covered in fallen leaves from the garden’s synth-trees. A single light came out of the building. *Papa’s study,* Erika remembered.

Erika felt Tristan tense on her shoulder as they approached the main entrance. By the time she knocked at the wooden gate, he was growling.

“Shhh, dear. Everything’s fine.” She knew better than to try to pet the cat now, but her words seemed to calm him somewhat.

“We’re not expecting visitors. Please leave the premises immediately.” Said a familiar, but rather agitated voice from the other side of the door.

“It’s me, Olin. Erika.” she answered. Then, turning to Tristan “see? It’s just Olin!” something in her tone made the cat relax a little bit.

“Mamzel? Could that really be you? Pardon my impropriety, please come in, come in!” A loud clink, a pneumatic hiss and a metallic thud followed those words, unbolting the door. The reinforced blast door started moving into the house, revealing the old butler’s hunched figure. “I beg your pardon, but one needs be careful these times.”

“Careful with what, Olin?” asked Erika. What could be so bad that it could threaten them here, in the Hills? Even worse – what could be so bad that *Olin* couldn’t deal with it?

“Best not to discuss it here, mamzel. Come in, I’ll have the servos prepare refreshments.” He signalled inside.

As Erika stepped through the threshold, Olin said “will that… *thing* be joining us?” Tristan’s ears perked up at the mention. He chirped, and stared at the butler intently.

“Yes, Olin. Tristan will be joining us. He’s been with me for years, he’s not staying outside now.”

“As you please, mamzel. I hope he doesn’t break anything.” Tristan looked as innocent as he could, and Erika remembered the torn seats on the flier.

*He hasn’t changed a bit*, Erika thought as they followed the old butler to the social room upstairs, *but something’s got him on edge, and it’s not Tristan*. He still wore the same black suit with the gold-embroidered lining around the cuffs and neck, and he walked with the same surprisingly brisk pace for someone his age.

*The house, however, has changed somewhat in these forty years*. Erika couldn’t put her finger on it. I*t feels… colder*.

“It’s unlike you to be so nervous, Olin.” Erika said while they were climbing the main staircase.

“Forgive me mamzel, but recent events have not been kind on my nerves.”

They were at the top of the staircase, in front of her father’s study. A bright orange glow of electric lamps filtered from under the door.

“There’s someone here to see you” Olin said, and signalling the half-opened wooden door.

Erika cursed under her breath. *That is not my father in there, then.* Whoever it was, better have a damn good reason to come at this time. They were standing between her and a much needed bath.

“Thank you, Olin. That will be all for now.”

“Of course, mamzel. I will prepare your room.”

The butler shuffled away, and Erika pushed the door open.

Her father’s study was exactly as she remembered it. Jordan Belcroft had been a busy man, but he rarely deviated from schedule or custom. The figure sitting in his chair, however, wasn’t her father. It was a short man, dressed in an impeccable violet truvelvet suit. His features were as sharp as his dress code. Erika had seen his face around. It was Chief System Officer Boris Markov himself, the head of the Sagitar Corporation here in Decorat. He was, in all regards that really mattered, the most powerful person in the city. Perhaps, even in the sector.

*He’s also a friend of father’s*, Erika recalled. She still remembered his visits. Her father, Boris and the others would come, lock themselves in that very study, and talk for hours. Now, he was fiddling with her father’s pen collection.

“Welcome back, Mamzel Belcroft.” He said, playfully balancing a very rare Foulcault 3578 between his index and thumb. “I trust you had a pleasant journey from the frontlines.”

“It has… sir.” She said, curtly. She didn’t really care for pleasantries right now.

“I must commend your father on his collection. He always had impeccable taste.” He had carefully set down the pen, and had picked up a different one “Did you know that they only made a hundred of these particular models of Ydris?”

“I did not” Erika said, with the best impression of a calm voice she could muster.

“They did! And look at this one. An original Mormont Dreamweaver! I must ask your father where he got it.”

“I’m sure it will be a riveting conversation.” Erika was on the brink of failing to be civil. “With all due respect, sir. Did the Sagitar Corporation pull me from my duty to discuss _pens_?”

Markov laughed “No, of course not. I guess we should get down to business.” He hesitated, and then put the pen down in its holder. “In fact, the Corporation hasn’t called you for much of anything! _I_ have personally requested your presence here.”

He was smiling a friendly, fake smile.

"You see, I currently face a bit of a mysterious situation. Dissapearances in the lower levels are up by 3% since last year." By Erika's estimation, that amounted to a few million.

"Now, a few missing people here and there is nothing out of the ordinary, but if this trend continues, it could damage the planet’s productivity output. That would put my career prospects in, let’s say, thin ice. And that, I can’t have" For a moment, his face had suddenly turned menacing. Then he smiled again.

“I’m sorry about that, sir, but I fail to see how this relates to me.”

“Ah. I was about to get there. Even as a child, you were always very impatient. I guess some things don’t change.” He paused. Erika decided that she didn’t like Markov very much. She was tired, and fishing for information was not something she wanted to do right now.

Eventually, he continued.

“Your father was amongst the dissappeared.” He proclaimed, putting the pen down.

He let the words hang in the air for a moment.

“I must admit, I was expecting more of a reaction from you, Belcroft” He said, surprised.

Erika had to agree. She should have been more shocked, terrified even. But a mixture of exhaustion and the fact that she already suspected something like this made her eyelashes fail to bat.

“Sorry to disappoint” Was all she said.

“I’ll survive. That’s not the only reason you’re here, though. Although poor Jordan’s disappearance is a tragedy, it’s hardly enough reason to pull such a promising officer from the frontlines.”

He paused. Again. *He’s making me work for it, and he’s enjoying this a bit too much,* Erika thought. Still there wasn’t much she could do but play along. She was at his mercy, and they both knew it.

“And what is?” She said.

“I currently face a bit of a dilemma. It’s the house, you see.” He said, picking another pen

“This house?” Erika said.

“Yes! This very house, your family’s seat for generations.” Another pause.

“What about it?”

“Well, this house is not actually property of the Belcrofts. It is, and it always has been, a loan from the Corporation. Your father, and those before, were allowed to reside in it in exchange of their services to us. It was loaned for the lifetime of your father’s. I’m afraid that, with his disappearance, the corporation is left in the uncomfortable position of finding someone to replace his post, and give them this house.”

“Wait, that would mean…” Despite the exhaustion, Erika sensed a shiver down her spine. She looked around, to the hundreds of years of history the mansion contained.

“Yes, you would of course have to find… alternative accommodations.” He meant The Grid.

“That is, unless” He continued. “*You* were willing to fulfil his post.” He finished, with an inquiring smile.

*So that’s your real motivation,* Erika thought. *You need someone to cover my father’s spot, but you don’t want to go through the hassle of finding a replacement, so you coerce me into doing it.*

Erika had no desire to tie herself to a desk. She was born to be in the field, and she had worked too hard on her career to give it up now. But it didn’t look like she had much of a choice. She couldn’t let all of this, all of the history her ancestors had cultivated, crumble.

In that moment, an idea came to her head.

“Sir, you said my father has disappeared, right?”

“Yes, why?”

“Well, he’s disappeared, not dead. Or, at least, we don’t know that yet. Until we have confirmed that, the contract still holds. Does it not?”

The CSO paused for a second. He then smiled “I guess so, you’re right. But the contract states that he will be terminated if he fails to fulfill his duties in a set period of time. He’s been gone for a few weeks already, you see, and there are only a few days left.”

“Then I’ll find him.” Erika blurted. She surprised herself with how quickly she had gotten to that answer.

Markov’s eyes lit up at that exclamation.

“That could work, yes. If you can manage it, say, before the Data Entry Rites?” He stood in silence for a bit more, considering something. “Right. It’s decided. I know you don’t like me much, but I considered your father a friend. You will come to the council meeting tomorrow, and we will talk specifics and provide what aid we can give. I’ll have to find a way to spin it to the other chancellors. For now, I must go. It’s indeed getting late, and more urgent matters require my attention. I’ll show myself out.”

With that, the short man got up from the big armchair, and made for the exit. He opened the door to the study, then sopped and turned.

“Oh, one more thing, mamzel Belcroft.” Again, the smile gave way to that dark stare “I cannot stress how important it is to keep this secret. You were not the only one brought here by the missing people. I have word that the Empire is taking interest, and an Inspector has landed today.”

He let those words hang for a few seconds, to emphasize their gravity. Erika didn’t need it emphasized. An Inspector coming was a universal sign of something going very wrong.

Boris smiled again.

“Well then! See you tomorrow!” He said, as he went down the stairs.

Erika sat at his father’s desk, thinking. After some time, Olin came, with a couple of cups and a decanter full of aromatic caffeine.

“Thank you, Olin” Erika said, rubbing her eyes. Using her augmetic eye, She measured 200 milliliters in each cup, and handed one to Olin.

She took a sip of the caffeine. It was good, nutty and with acid notes. Some of the body had been lost in the brewing, though.

“Servos made this, correct?” She asked the butler.

“Yes, mamzel. Your taste is as impeccable as your father’s. He also noticed these things.”

“I know,” She answered, sullenly. “He taught me. It’s good though, not bad for a machine.”

“Thank you. I’ve been trying to program them to reproduce my brewing.” The butler seemed distracted with something. “Mamzel, about Markov.”

“Yes?” She took a second sip.

“Is everything alright?” The butler asked.

She took a deep breath, trying to process what had just happened.

“No, Olin.” She sunk into the armchair, rubbing her temples. “It is not. But we will make it right.”

# Home

Rien was annoyed as he got to the magtram station. Using his rig-card, he skipped over the toll gates. Luci had helped him develop the small plastic key, and now he could travel for free across all of Decorat.

By the time the train stopped in the deserted station of Level 185, he was fuming.

*Two weeks! Two weeks I’d been following that ninker, and she comes off that big ship all fancy, and gets him arrested in two seconds! Didn’t even get to ask his frakking name! Then go ask her what's up, and she brushes me off!*

Rien punctuated his words with a kick to the station’s wall.

“Fuck!” That hurt. The pain helped him focus. Rien took a deep breath. “Calm down, Rien. Steady hands, just like Luci taught you.”

He looked around, adjusting his eyes to the lower levels of light. The tram ran all throughout the city, including the upper levels, so the cabins were well lit. But here, down in the Grid, it was a different story. The station had no roof. It was a single, long slab of rockrete, lit by a strip of cold, flickering lights. The lack of shelter wasn’t usually a problem during the day – rush hour brought in more than enough people to fight off even the harshest of mornings – but right now Rien was feeling the winter cold soak to his bones. Still, he thanked the Empire that nobody was in the station to see his outburst.

With a slight limp to avoid overbearing his toe, Rien headed towards one of the metallic bridges that connected the station with the lumbering mass of the Grid. As his boots clanged their way across the platform, he saw that one of the guardrails was broken. Rien wondered if it was the result of some poor soul falling. It was a long way down from Level 190, West Cuadrant.

*Huh. I wonder how long that’s been there. They should get that fixed.*

Then he stopped, and chuckled. He had spent too much time uptown, we was turning posh. He shook his head, continuing towards the sea of lights that was his block.

As he approached the giant wall of habs, he started looking for the usual faces in the usual spots. The Grids were usually quiet at night, but one could still see the facade peppered with small lights coming from small windows on the hab doors. In fact, from where Rien was, one could see almost everything happening outside of the cramped prefabs: The small groups of people quietly sharing a smoke and the news of the day. The people marching to the communal bathrooms, looking for late night relief. Teenagers, sneaking out to meet with their friends or lovers.

People here didn’t have much, but Rien felt more at home than he had all day, pursuing the madman through the upper levels. Even the smog felt easier to breathe somehow.

Rien was pondering this as he made his way up the stairs to his hab in Level 209, when a familiar voice called his name.

“Hey, kid! What’cha up to, this late at night?”

Rien looked to his right. Lucitav was making signs from his chair. Rien approached the old man, smiling.

“Not much, Luci. Just went up to see the sky is all” Lucitav wouldn’t buy today’s excuse either, and Rien knew that already. He’d even made a game out of it, every night trying to come up with a wilder reason than the last. Luci wasn’t smiling.

“You know I don’t like you messing with the upper crusters. No good can come out of it. You should focus on doing good at the shop, and leave the big problems for the big wigs.” That speech, on the other hand, didn’t change at all from night to night.

“Don’t worry old man, I can cover my ass.” *It’s not like I have a choice, anyway*.

“Don’t call me old man, you snote!” He wasn’t really that old, barely hitting 40. But 40 years were a long time in the Grids, and more for someone with Lucitav’s life. Plus, Rien loved to tease him about it. “You better be right about covering your ass, otherwise you’ll end up like… like…”

Lucitav lowered his voice, and then his eyes. Rien felt a pang of guilt in the chest for picking on the man. *Like Marsha*, he thought. A silence fell on the balcony and they both looked outside, to the cascade of lights that was Decorat’s nightlife, letting the seconds pass. Remembering.

“I’m sorry, Lucy. I’ll be careful, I promise.”

“You better be, kid. You better be.” Said Lucitav, his eyes still fixed on the millions of lights before them. “I’m tired, I’m going to bed. You have a good night, and tell your sister I say hi.” He said. He got up, using his crutches to make up for his missing right leg. The door to his hab slid open with a hiss and a clang, and the broken man limped inside.

“Good night, *old man*” Rien said, trying to lighten the mood.

Lucitav chuckled drily, and the door to his hab slid closed.

Rien climbed two more floors and walked left until he got to Hab Block 1337, Level 209. *Home*. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what came next.

Fortunately, she was still sleeping when the hab door slid open. Rien entered the hab, quietly taking his boots off. He moved sideways, feeling the cold rockrete in the space between their bed and the left wall. He was so focused on stealth that his left foot bumped on the chair, dropping some of her medicine bottles to the floor with a loud thud.

“Shit!” He exclaimed, pain flaring from his toes up his calf. That was the foot he’d stubbed earlier. Cel groaned, stirred and turned, taking the bedsheets with her. Heart pounding, Rien stood perfectly still, counting to ten.

Trying not to make a sound that would disturb his sister’s peace, Rien bent over to pick up the fallen vial. *Thank the Empire, it’s still intact.* Rien thought. The last thing he needed was to have to go buy another dose. One last look at Cel told him that it was probably safe to move again, and he started making his way towards the sink, this time looking at where he was going.

Rien let out his breath when he finally got to the other end of the room, realizing that he had been holding it since the incident with the chair. He yawned, and started changing into his night clothes.

He hadn’t even removed his jacket when Cel sprung up, screaming.

“No! No, no! Get away!” screamed his sister, as she sat upright, covering her face with her hands.

Rien rushed to her side.

“Shh, Cel. It’s me, I’m here” He said, putting his arms around her shoulders. Rien could feel her sister’s cold sweat on her warm skin, and — most worrying of all — her heart pumping wildly.

“Get away!” Cel’s hands were waving wildly in the air now fighting an invisible foe. Her eyes were wide open, bloodshot, looking with fear at something that wasn’t there. Rien held her tighter. Cel was older and stronger than him, but he refused to let go.

“It’s me, Cel. It’s Rien. You’re safe, you’re with me”.

Seconds passed, then minutes. Eventually, slowly, Rien started feeling Cel’s body relax. Her eyes started coming into focus, and her breathing became more regular.

“Is it… you, Rien?” Her voice was a whisper.

“I’m here, Cel.” Rien let go of his sister and sat beside her on the unmade bed, giving her space to breath.

“I’ve had another dream.” She said. She was on the brink of tears.

“Yeah…” That wasn’t what Cel needed to hear, but it was the best Rien could do right now. His eyes fixed on the tiny patch of uncluttered space left on the floor of the hab. The nightmares were getting worse, and they came more frequently now. He didn’t know how much longer Cel could keep this up. Damn, *he* didn’t know how long *he* would be able to keep it up.

Cel looked at him, and her expression changed instantly. She wiped her eyes with her arm and sprang up the bed, making the rusty springs creak.

“Terra! You must be hungry, Ry!” she said in a cheerful tone. “Let me make us some dinner. What do you say to a couple of bricks?”

Rien didn’t really know what the carb-bricks were made of, but he started feeling better when Cel started frying a cuple on the small stovetop. He hadn’t realized how hungry he was until the smell started filling the room, but now his stomach was rumbling.

Cel turned around shortly, two steaming plated in hand. “Make some room, will you?”

Rien sprang into action. He cleared the chair moving the medicine to the small shelf above the bed, made the bed and sat down, all in a matter of seconds. Cel passed him a plate, and they started eating.

“What were you doing out so late, anyway?” said Cel after a while.

“Following that ninker from the other day.” said Rien. Bits of brick jumped out of his mouth “I —”

“Don’t talk with your mouth full, Ry” said Cel without lifting her gaze off her plate.

“— Sorry” Rien gulped. “I followed him all the way uptown, to the port, but he started making a scene, and this lady knocked right out. She looked military, but she was dressed all fancy. I think she was a noble or something. She wasn’t afraid of the Enforcers.”

“Wait, back up. You went to the upper levels? To the port?”

“Yeah”

“Ry, were you careful?” she said, with more than a note of worry in her voice.

“Well, I think I was. I don’t think anyone saw me. Maybe her cat?”

“Her cat?” Cel turned to him, interested.

“Yeah, she had a cat some neat augmetics. That lady has money, I tell you. I was scared for a moment there, but she wasn’t interested in a Gridder like me.”

“Huh. Fancy that.” Cel went back to her plate and continued eating. “And then what happened?”

“Then I came back! I saw old Lucy on his chair, he gave me the usual speech”

“He’s right, you know.” said Cel, putting down her empty plate and looking at Rien. “I don’t like these escapades either. I’m worried about you.”

“Well, we don’t have a better plan” Rien shrugged. “Until we know what’s going on with you, I’m going to keep looking. You didn’t see how that man was, but I’m not letting you go nuts like that.” Rien looked at Cel. Something she saw in his eyes made her expression soften.

“I’m sorry to put you through this, brother.”

“That’s okay” said Rien, with all the sincerity his tired face could muster. “you’d do the same for me”.

Rien got up and picked the plates, making Cel understand that he was done talking about it.

“You better get some rest” he said, signalling the bed.

“Leave that, I’ll wash it tomorrow” said Cel, lying on the bed.

“Don’t worry, I got it” said Rien, dropping the dishes in the sink.

“Okay, suit yourself.” Cel was half asleep already.

When he was done washing the dishes, Rien reached up to the shelf, looking for the small vial. His shoulders sunk as he collapsed on the chair, exhausted.

He loaded the needle with the sedative, and he went to sleep hoping he wouldn’t have to use it that night.

# Spires

Erika looked at the great, closed door in front of her. It was entirely made of wood, real wood, with Sagitar Corp’s insignia etched in each of the leaves.

She was dressed in a white two-piece suit, with the only accessories being her house’s insignia enbroidered on the left breastpocket and her military accolades on the right. Her outfit was spotless as usual, but Erika noticed that she had lost some weight. The synthsilk jacket was a little bit baggier than she remembered. Military rations weren’t the most nutritive of meals.

She pushed these thoughts away as she listened to the other side of the door. The Sagitar Planet Management Council were meeting to discuss the Data Entry Rites scheduled to happen in a few weeks.

“… There’s simply not enough money, Li. It cannot be done.” She heard a deep, male voice say on the other side.

“Then raise prices, Lobos. You more than anyone know how much this planet depends on the Rites.” Another voice said, this time female. There was a very obvious frustration in that voice. “This year’s data shipment will double last year’s. *Double!* If we don’t expand the data-docks, the fuel expenses alone will eat up all the profits! Dana, back me up here, please?”

“Well, I think —” Started a third, Dana, a very high-pitched female voice.

“And who is going to buy, Li?” Lobos interrupted her, now also sounding frustrated. “We’re already gauging the eyes out of everyone in this city. They buy our food, they take it to our houses, and cook it with our energy. We even bought the Fingers so they die in our hospitals!”

“I have to agree with Lobos on this one, Li” Dana said.

“Thank you!” Said Lobos, interrupting. “Finally somebody else understands that two plus two is four”

“Let me speak.” Dana seemed calm, but Lobos didn't interrupt this time. “The biggest problem is the rate of disappearances. We have lost a few hundred thousand more people than expected this quarter. What Lobos is trying to explain is that it’s really eaten into our profits.”

A fourth voice started speaking, and Erika identified it as Markov.

“Dear colleagues. You are all correct in your assessments. Li, you’re right that we need to expand the stardock if we hope to have a profit at the end of the rights. Lobos and Dana, you’re right that we cannot accomplish that if there’s less people to sell things to.” Markov’s voice was calm and reassuring. “However, we still have options. Erika, would you please come in?”

At that mention, the great wooden gates started to creak open, revealing the council room.

The only furniture was a large, round mahogany table. The four council members were sitting in high-back thrones spread around evenly across its circumference. Erika couldn’t make out their faces, as the warm evening sun bursted through the glass wall at the end of the room, enveloping the chancellors in shadow.

Erika straightened her jacket one last time, and stepped in.

“Fellow council members, this is Erika Belcroft. She will help us find our missing customers.” Nabokov said, raising his arm towards the approaching Erika.

As she approached, the soles of her boots resonated on the marble tiles. The three council members fell silent. Now that she was closer, Erika could distinguish her faces. She saw a mixture of interest and contempt in their eyes. Erika held their gaze, defiant.

Lobos was the first to speak.

“This is what you have, Markov? A military officer?” He looked like a man in his early forties, with a whitening but well-kept beard and a blue suit. He also looked angry. "And a low rank, nonetheless. Are you out of your mind?"

“We finally agree on something, Lobos.” The voice belonged to Li. Erika saw a woman, apparently in her late fifties, dressed in a one-piece green silk dress that crossed across her breast. She was sitting with her back straight, and the only movement in her body were her lips. If Erika hadn’t heard her outburst before, she would have sworn the woman was as cold as ice.

“Dunno, I kind of like her” Said another chancellor, amused. She was sitting back in her throne, one leg raised and resting on one of the armrests. Erika identified her as Dana. She was a petite woman, and didn’t look more than twenty. Of course, Erika knew better than to trust that someone in this position would actually _be_ the age they looked. Rejuv treatments were commonplace among the elite. She was probably much, much older than her.

Markov ignored them, and turned to Erika.

“Thank you for coming, mamzel Belcroft. Let me make proper introductions. The man who seems so displeased with you is Tax and Revenue Chancellor Simon Lobos. The woman sitting so still next to him is Zhu Li, our Infrastructure Chancellor. You, like everyone in a twenty mile radius, have no doubt heard them argue about the Rites.” He shot a severe look at them, and they somehow seemed to recoil “And this lovely lady is Population Chancellor Dana Atsuki, the voice of reason.” The young chancellor waved at Erika.

“Now that we all know each other, we can talk business.” Markov continued. “Mamzel Belcroft here is no common line officer. She studied in the Academy, here in Decorat, where she consistently excelled in intelligence gathering and covert assault. I’ve been following her career, and she has racked up an impressive resume, both on and off the field. We all want to find the missing people, and she’s going to help us do that.”

“That all sounds good, but the Academy spits out thousands of exceptional people every year.” Lobos had calmed down, but he still seemed distrustful. “Be honest with us, Boris. Why bring someone in from the frontlines?”

Erika stared at Lobos. She didn’t like someone challenging her abilities so openly.

“You’re not all gone after all, Simon. You’re right, we have many like her. It’s precisely *because* she’s been in the frontlines for so long. We have screened her communication logs, and she hasn’t been in touch with anyone in the planet for decades. I’m sure she has no connection with the disappearances which, honestly, is more than I can say about you three.”

Lobos thought for a second, and then shrugged and nodded “That’s fair.”

“Furthermore, she’s motivated. Her father is among the disappeared.”

For a split second, Zhu Li’s lips betrayed a tight smile “Well done, Boris. Now, next time, please tell us before we waste our time arguing, will you?”

“Ah, but where’s the fun in that?” Markov winked at Erika. Erika smirked lightly.

She didn’t like the man, or any of the other chancellors, but she appreciated the display of leadership skill. He had probably instigated the discussion himself, all in order to bring her as the solution to the problem. There was a reason he practically ruled the planet.

Heavy footsteps sounded behind Erika. When she turned to look, she saw a tower of a man approaching the table. His plain white was splotched with stains, and his balding head shone with beads of sweat.

“Right on time, Mr. Boch!” Markov said. Erika considered the perfect timing of the new arrival. Somehow, she didn’t believe it was a coincidence “Erika, this is Damian Boch, one of our chiefs of security. If you please follow him, he will provide you with the people and resources you’ll need.”

“I don’t want any men. I work alone.” Erika said, a bit more strongly than she’d hoped. She felt overpowered and disrespected, and that put her on edge.

“Just as well.” Markov said, unmoved. “Just remember what’s a stake. Mr Boch, please escort mamzel Belcroft outside, and brief her on the details. We have other matters to discuss.”

“Of course, sir” Said the man, wheezing. He turned to leave, Erika followed.

The wooden gates closed as she exited the room, but Erika could still hear Lobos.

“… and she is expendable. If she ends up dead in a ditch, this won’t come back to us”.

Somehow, that didn’t surprise her.

---

“That’s a nice piece you got there. What is it, a Montesco?”

Chief Boch said this over his shoulder, or at least tried to. His mass pressed Erika to the elevator wall, and she could see how his neck muscles prevented him from turning his head. Still, Erika appreciated someone who knew their way around a cane-sword.

“Thank you, and yes”, She said, unsheathing the blad hiding in her cane a couple of centimetres. She turned it on, and the air suddenly filled with the buzz of ozone. “It’s a family heirloom, my grandfather had it made. 1.5 meters, galvanic core. Hasn’t failed me yet.”

“I wish they gave us that kind of kit” Boch seemed genuinely hopeful. “All we get are solid slug guns and batons, none of that military issue las-stuff” Boch looked at the flight marker in the elevator, daydreaming.

Erika smiled, grateful that he wasn’t able to see her. *You don’t need that “las-stuff” to control drunk civilians*, she thought. What’s the worst that one could face so far from the frontlines?

The elevator dinged, and the doors gave way to a much less extravagantly decorated hallway. Plain off-white plaster walls formed a hallway lined with same-looking office doors.

Boch exited the elevator, directed her to one of them. Erika took that moment to stretch herself after being cooped up for what seemed an eternity.

The inside of Boch’s office was as unimpressive as the outside. A single table, a single screen, a single cup of burnt caffeine, and a few piles of unread dataslates. Boch took a seat behind his desk, and directed Erika to do the same.

“So. Erika Belcroft, is it?” He said, picking a dataslate and wiping the caffeine splashes from it. “Major of the 154th Decoratian Expansion Corps. That right?”

Erika nodded.

“All right. I don’t know why the bosses brought *you* here. To be honest, I don’t care. But hey, they’ve told me to give you a hand.”

“I don’t need your —”

“Don’t care.” He cut her off. “Big bosses tell me yo give you a hand, I give you a hand. And you should take it too, if you know what’s good for you. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner you can go do whatever you want.” He wasn’t even looking at her, he was slurping his caffeine.

“Here’s the deal. People have been dissappearing, big time. More than usual, and that’s hurting the bosses. My people are busy patrolling the spires, and making sure everything is tip-top for the big procession, so they need you to find them.” Sagitar had tens of thousands of security personnel in Decorat, and Erika doubted that they needed all of them for “preparations”.

“I knew that alread —“

“Again, miss. I have to go through this, whether we like it or not. The sooner you let me finish, the sooner I can go back to my job. We have only been able to establish a single thread. The *TruJoi* club, a PleaseCog place down in Pleasure Level 157. You have your father to thank for that, we’ve only made that connection because the boss told us to look into him. He used to frequent it. If I were you, I’d start from there.”

Erika was genuinely shocked. “How do you know my father was frequenting that club?” Her father, in one of those crapholes…

“That I cannot tell you, but I was hoping it was rather obvious.” He didn’t seem phased at all, like this was all business as usual. “That’s all I got.” He said, and sat back, sipping his caffeine. “Now piss off.”

As Erika was getting up to leave, he remembered something. He rummaged in his drawers for a bit “Almost forgot. The bosses also told me to give you this” He handed her a shiny plastek card with the Sagitar logo and her biodata on it. “That’s clearance, a *free pass* if you will. Use it if things get ugly. Now that’s it. Go, I have work to do.”

Erika wasn’t convinced of that last statement, but she picked up the pass and left anyway.

# Descent

“Decorat is great for many reasons, Tristan” Erika told the cat curled up in the passenger seat of her grav-car. “But The Grids aren’t one of them.”

From the crystal windows of the flier’s cabin, they could see the translucent miasma approaching them, signaling their entrance into the lower hive. Down there, the recycled air was mixed with exhaust from the cooling systems that kept the Archive’s underground vault running. It was technically breathable, but not by much.

Not many people below the Great Archive had the luxury of fliers, so the sky was empty, and Erika had no problem following the mag-tram’s tracks downhill. As she entered the cloud of smog, she could see the top of the gigant pile of hab-blocks that formed the Grid. While every hab in the Grid fit perfectly with its neighbours, the Grid – like Decorat’s population – was ever expanding. When one of the blocks malfunctioned, it was often easiest to stack a new one on top. This meant that new blocks were constantly being added to the top of the building, and the population as a whole moved steadily upward.

*Some day*, she thought, *they will build the towers so tall that they will rise above the smog.* Judging by the current state of things, however, that wouldn’t happen for a few thousand years.

It also meant that Erika had no place to land her flier. The top of the building was covered in half-built blocks, and she refused squarely to get to ground level. Not even the Gridders themselves went to that abandoned carcass of old habs.

Erika cursed her luck. *This is what I get for coming down to this dump.*

She would have to be quick, and leave the engine running. She sighed, and started descending into the mountains of concrete, searching for *The TruJoi*.

She found it in one of the Pleasure Levels. The flier stopped, suspended above a drop a hundred levels deep, and the driver’s door hissed open. It was a long way down, but Erika had seen worse.

She leapt across the chasm into the steel sidewalk, and breathed in.

Or, rather, she tried to. Down there, the thick air slid down one’s throat like warm honey. She doubled over coughing for a few seconds, while her lungs accustomed to the heavy smog. She couldn’t wait to get out of there.

*It’s not just the air*, she thought, looking at the neon lights trying to attract all the poor devils that came here in search of relief and oblivion. *Even in off hours, this place stinks of sweat and excess.*

Tristan’s legs clanged loudly when he leapt beside her.

“Let’s go, dear.” She said, pulling the clearance badge that Boch had given her “the sooner we are done with this, the sooner we can get out”

---

The *TruJoi’s* façade was the same as the dozes of PleaseCog bars on the street: Neon silhouette holograms of naked people with bright-colored skin invited people to go through the dimly lit threshold covered by opaque plastik curtains.

As Erika approached, a sweaty mass tumbled outside. A man, dressed in low-level Cognitor operator clothes, smelling of rank sweat and even ranker liquor, smiling as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Erika managed to avoid him and keep her clothes clean.

“This is what a fallen person looks like, Tristan. Instead of doing something with their lives, they waste them here.” As she pushed the curtain, she wondered again why her father had come to one of these places.

Inside, a clerk was smiling behind a small plastek counter. He was dressed in the colorful plastek suits that Gridders considered fancy.

“A pod for one, mamzel? We have a few fresh memories that may suit someone such as yourself.” He waved a hand over the counter, and several hologram silhouettes appeared, performing a variety of sexual activities, some of which Erika had never thought possible.

“That’s not what I’m looking fo—”

“Oh, I see!” The clerk answered quickly, and his eyes widened. “Apologies, madam. I should have guessed.” He glanced at Tristan. “Perhaps something more… exotic?”

He started waving his hand, but Erika did not want to see what was going to show. She grabbed him by the wrist.

“Cut the crap.” She slammed her fist on the desk, squashing one of the holograms. The clerk’s face sobered. “I’m not here for a good time. I’m here to answer some questions. I’m looking for Jordan Belcroft. He’s a client. Do you know him?”

“Ah. I’m afraid I can’t answer that, mamzel. The *TruJoi* prides itself on its discretion.”

“Ha! A pit like this? Alright, let’s play that way.” She pulled the clearance sheet from her longcoat. “How about now? Can you tell me now?”

The clerk examined the card for a moment. He didn’t seem happy, but he seemed to recognize the Corporation’s insignia. His eyes locked into Erika’s he pulled his wrist free from her grasp.

“That seems official, indeed. I need to verify with my manager, and that can take a while.” He tapped some symbols in his terminal, and handed Erika a pink hexagonal piece of plastic with the number 18 written in white letters. “Here. Please wait in pod 18, you’re scaring away the customers. It’s right down the hall.”

He waved behind him, towards a staircase that seemed to descend into a pit of dim magenta light.

---

Erika stepped down the stairs. Her eyes adjusted to the low purple right instantly, and she could see a long passageway, surrounded by cylindrical plastek tubes on either side. The tubes were wide enough to fit a handful of people, but each of them contained a single seat.

Erika felt the sticky floor as she made her way down the hall. At this hour, most of the PleaseCog pods were empty, and their doors doors were open. Inside each of the cubicles, a single plas-leather armchair occupied most of the space. A helmet, with several cables connecting it to the chair, lay on a hook on top of the headrest.

The air was heavier and the light was dimmer as she approached the end of the hallway. She passed a pod in use, its door closed.

“Hi-hi! Yes, that’s right dear.” A playful voice laughed from the other side.

*Such an invention, a marvel of engineering, used for… this.* She thought, as she made her way down the pods.

Erika felt repulsed by the mere concept of PleaseCogs. These machines, Cognitors, allowed humans to search and relive vast arrays of data by replaying it in their conscious minds. They were designed to support the Great Archive, where queries were distributed across hundreds of Cognitors who dug through millenia of data.

Here, they had a very different purpose. These machines had been corrupted in their purpose. They connected to custom databanks of illicit memories. People here weren’t serving any higher purpose, they were looking for an experience, a fantasy. People came here to waste their lives.

The next pod was also in use, but no laughter came out of it. Instead, Erika heard a series of violent thuds and low moans of pain. She didn’t want to know what memory was being relived. Tristan noticed it too, and he hissed at the door.

Finally, she made it to the end of the hallway. It was dead quiet here, not even the air seemed to have moved in the last week. Pod 18 was standing right in front of her, surrounded by two other closed pods.

As Erika opened it, she realized something. It was dead quiet. *It’s a trap.*

The doors of the surrounding pods slammed open, and two shapes came at her. That split second realization gave her the headway she needed to avoid the first hit, but something blunt hit her in the right arm as she rolled into Pod 18, sending ripples of pain through her arm.

Erika groaned, and turned to face the assailants. A man and a woman, both strong, both wielding riot batons, were coming at her for a second blow. It was a constrained space, so Erika couldn’t unsheathe her weapons. She’d have to get creative.

Erika grabbed the interface of the PleaseCog with her left hand. At her signal, Tristan launched himself to the woman’s face, as Erika tossed the heavy metal helmet to the man.

The assailants weren’t expecting that. The woman stumbled and fell under the weight of the augmented animal, but the man managed to dodge the projectile.

*Crap, now I have to actually do this with just one good arm*.

She dashed towards the man, raising her left fist for a punch. She was not as strong as him, and they both knew it. The man smiled, and raised the baton to deflect the punch.

In the last second, Erika used her momentum to dive and slide past the man, much to his surprise. She sprang up behind him, and delivered the same expert blow that had knocked out the man in the starport.

The goon’s unconscious body fell to the floor with a quiet *thud*.

Erika turned her attention to the woman, who was still trying to wrestle Tristan out of her face. Erika walked up to her, and placed a knee on her chest, pinning her down to the floor.

“Who sent you?” She asked. The woman’s answer was muffled by Tristan’s fur. “Tristan, dear. Please let her speak” The cat stared at her, and moved away reluctantly. “Now, I won’t ask again. Who sent you?”

“Go to hell.” The woman answered.

“Okay, fair enough. I can respect that” Erika said. Right before knocking her out. “But I can’t have you following me either.”

Erika examined her right hand. It was probably broken. It was about to turn personal with these people, now she had something else to settle.

She stormed up the stairs, and grabbed the clerk by the collar.

“You! Do you know what trouble you’ve just gotten you boss into? You do know what this is, right?” She asked, shoving the clearance card on his face.

“Of course!” Said the clerk, his face smiling despite it being pushed against the counter. “The question is, do _you_ know? I encourage you to contact your boss, and really figure out the worth of that license, before you barge in here asking questions again.”

He seemed too confident for a man who just had two of his goons knocked out. Erika was starting to think he was right.

“… I do hope you have enjoyed our appetizer service. If you’d like to stay, the main is about to arrive.” Reluctantly, Erika released the man, and he straightened his clothes. “That’s what I thought.”

Erika groaned, and made for the door. As she was about to reach for the courtains, she heard the snarky voice of the clerk behind her.

“Thank you, come again!”

It took all of her willpower to keep walking out and leave the smug clerk behind. Somebody would pay for her hand. Her father was probably never been there in the first place. She had some questions to ask Boch.

---

The light of a newsglobe zooming overhead blinded Rien momentarily.

"*Thank you for doing your part in keeping the Grand Archive running. Enjoy your celebration. The Sagitar Corporation values you, very much"* Blasted the tinny speakers of the aircraft.

Standing before the *Interchange*, Rien looked around, at the nightlife swirling through the streets of the Pleasure Level 185.

Thousands of people dressed in colorful plastek suits crossed the bridges that connected the bars and clubs of this level. They hopped from one to the other, attracted to the neon lights like moths. Despite the blinding lights, Rien couldn’t help but notice how the this level seemed more menacing than the hab blocks further up the Grid. It was hard to put a finger on it, but something in the looming towers of ads for cheap thrills made him feel on edge.

For the poor people of Decorat, the Pleasure Levels were an escape valve. And an escape valve were loud and aggressive.

He almost lost balance and fell when somebody bumped his shoulder. A loud crash made him realize that he had knocked down somebody’s bottle.

“S-scuse me! You gonna pay for that, you little shit?” said the woman, as Rien turned.

Her two-piece orange and purple outfit was torn and dirty in places. She had dyed her hair electric blue, and was very clearly about to get a kick of Druema, the cheap drug that flowed freely in the fleshy currents of the Pleasure Level crowd.

Realizing the state of the woman, Rien ignored her.

“Oi! I’m’s talkin’ to yo—” The woman didn’t get to finish her sentence. The Druema kicked in, her pupils dilated, and her expression became a lot more friendly. The strong opioid did that to people. “Nevermind…” said the woman with a big, friendly smile. Deep in a sea of pleasant thoughts, she started waddling to a bar down the street.

Rien focused on his goal. They had run out of sedatives, and the *Interchange* was the only place he would be able to get a refill. Despite the ominous name,  the place was little more than a hole punched on an old hab-block. An old woman in a plain gray coat worked behind a small metallic counter where Druema — and other, harder substances — regularly exchanged hands. She was visibly balding, and she was reading volume 249 of an erotic zine. The only thing that set *The Interchange* apart from all other dispensaries was that Rien didn’t have a tab with them… yet.

*Well, here goes nothing* He told himself, stepping up to the shopkeeper.

“Good night!” He said, with the most sincere smile he could.

“Good, bad, all nights are the same, boy. What do you want? I’m busy here.” she said, putting the dataslate down.

“I need something for the pain.” Rien said.

“You’ll need to be more specific, boy.” If she had any patience left in her reserve, it was quickly dwindling. “Druema? Anix? Ditrix? C’mon!”

“No, no. Something stronger.” Rien leaned in closer, and whispered “Something for the Shivers.”

“Ha! That’s going to cost you. Two thousand credits for five vials.”

“Two thousand!” Rien was genuinely shocked “that’s double what they charge at the Medic Ward!”

“Well, if you could get the official stuff, we wouldn’t be talking, now would we boy?” She said with a sly smile. She was right. She had got him.

“Fine.” Rien said with a sigh. “Will you at least give me credit? I don’t have the cash with me right now.”

Rien mentally crossed his fingers. He didn’t have a way to repay the credit, but he also needed the medicine.

The woman stood there, examining him intently. As he felt the mass of tall, sweaty, drunk adults shuffling against his back, Rien felt very small.

Suddenly, Rien heard a sharp hiss and a wet crunch coming from inside of *The Interchange.* A blood-curding scream of agony followed a second later.

The woman saw the expression in Rien’s face and smiled a crooked, wicked smile.

“Of course we can extend credit. But don’t forget to pay on time. Two thousand plus interest, that’s… yeah, three grand. Have it ready for next week, or… well, you heard.”

Rien swallowed audibly. Three thousand credits. He had no idea how to get that much. But his sister couldn't sleep without the drugs, and this was the only option left.

In less than two minutes, they had signed the credit contract, and five clear vials of tranquilizers had exchanged hands.

Rien walked away, back to his hab, terrified. At some point, they would try to claim the debt, they would realize that he had no money, and Rien would be in real trouble.

But that was later, and his sister needed the him now.

# The Law

Erika squirmed with pain.

“Please, mamzel, try not to move so much.” Olin said, visibly trying to contain a laugh.

Sitting on the tall armchair, having her hand worked on by a servo, Erika wasn’t amused.

“Is this funny to you, Olin?” She asked, with another wince of pain. The pale flesh of the cyborg torso’s arm had pinched her. She couldn’t believe it, but she realised she missed the battlefield med-servos.

“Of course not, mamzel.” The corners of his mouth were starting to curve upwards “But please remind me one more time what that clerk told you on your way out.” His attempt at containment failed, and he burst out a chuckle. “Mamzel, you should really inform yourself on the proper etiquette before going somewhere.”

“Leave. It. Be. and please call for some caffeine.” Erika snapped. An alert appeared in her eye augment. An incoming communication request, from Boch. She blinked, and the image of the security chief projected into the middle of the room.

“Damian, I was about to call you. What is this crap clearance you’ve given me? I just got assaulted by a couple of lowlifes down in the Grid.”

“'evening to you too.” He said, looking worried “That’s why I call.”

“And too long it has taken you! They’ve busted up my arm, you should have the whole place decomissioned!”

“Ha!” That was the first time Erika had seen Boch smile “You got it all wrong, Belcroft. I’ve received word that you’ve been stirring up trouble. You need to cut that out, now. Be more tactful next time.”

“More tactful! They weren’t tactful when they broke my damn hand!” She scoffed and pulled the card out of her coat. “You told me this clearance meant something!”

“To the Enforcers! That card is Sagitar official clearance, which means you won’t get arrested by Enforcers. The company can’t help if you get yourself killed because you assaulted a gang PleaseCog bar.”

Erika couldn’t believe her ears “You could have said that sooner, you know. I’m a Major of the Expansion Corps, I don’t need protection from *Enforcers.*”

“And I’m busy with my real work, and don’t give a shit. Whatever. In fact, you don’t want to stir anything up with the gangs. It’s an open secret that the company makes a lot of money selling them Druema and used Cognitors. If it comes to you or the gangs, believe me, it’s not *them* that will end up in a freezer.”

Erika slammed her fist againtst the armchair, which sent a whip of pain through her forearm. Olin’s smile widened. She decided missed the straightforwardness of the battlefield. There, your enemies were always in front of you.

“Well then how do you propose I find anything out, if I can’t ask?”

“Not my problem, Belcroft. But you better do something, quick. Also, you should go see that Enforcer you had a run-in with at the starport. You didn’t have clearance then, you’re witness to a case.”

“I know, Boch. Anything else you haven’t told me?”

“No, that’s all. Don’t take it out on me, Belcroft. I’m just the messenger.” He said, and he hung up.

Erika sighed, and rubbed her temple. “This just keeps getting better and better. What are you still smiling at, Olin?”

“Nothing, mamzel. I’ll get the caffeine ready.”

He was still grinning when he came back with the steaming cup.

---

Enforcer Vanya Minsk yawned, sipped her caffeine, and went back to typing. Her desk, full of last night’s paperwork, was just one of the hundreds of identical tables covering the fifth floor of the Enforcer headquarters. But she had chosen the position very carefully.

From her vantage point at the end of the room, she had seen that Belcroft storm into the office. She had also seen how she talked with reception, and they pointed her towards her desk.

Now, she had time to prepare her questions, and dispatch that pompous brut as quickly as possible.

“Let’s make this quick, agent.” said Erika, as she sat down on the worn plastek chair. She was obviously not in a good mood. Vanya lifted her eyes from the mountain of papers she was handling, and tried very hard to remove the frown from her eyebrows.

She took a moment to read her witness.

*Long, gray stormcoat, military. House insignia etched on the breastpocket, officer chevrons. Standard issue laspistol, and – is that a cane? definitely not standard issue. Must be a family heirloom.*

"I agree. Let’s make this quick." Neither of them wanted this to be longer than it needed to be. *At least she hasn’t brought the cat.*

Vanya rummaged around one of her drawers. Where was the damn thing? She could almost feel that ninker’s eyes rolling.

A few seconds later, she placed a small, rectangular voxcorder on the table.

“For record keeping.” She clarified as she turned it on. “Please state your name.”

“Erika Belcroft.”

“Where were you two nights ago?”

“I was in the Decorat starport, just arriving from recall.”

“What brings you back, mamzel Belcroft?”

“I don’t think that’s relevant.” Erika answered curtly.

*That’s interesting*, thought Vanya. *She’s hiding something.* She pressed a little further.

“I’m afraid it’s not you who decides that.”

The woman seared her with a furious look. Then she *smiled.*

“If you must know, I was here to see my father.”

“That’s odd. Not a lot of veterans come back just to see family. Must have been hard to pull the strings to get back”

“It was” she said. Her mouth was smiling, but her silence said *“keep asking, and I’ll show you first hand what strings I can pull.”*

Vanya wasn’t scared.

“Still, I can imagine it was an emergency of sorts. How is your father, mamzel Belcroft?”

*That hit a nerve,* Vanya thought. *Something tells me it has something to do with all these weird cases we’ve been getting lately.*

It only lasted for a second, though, and before long Erika’s face was back to that menacing stare.

“Alright, that’s enough” said Erika while she pulled something out of her coat. She handed it to Vanya. *Damn. A clearance from Sagitar. There’s definitely something going on here.*

But she couldn’t do anything against that license.

“Let’s go to more relevant questions. Can you describe the events in the starport?”

“I can.” Was all she said. *Oh, Sol,* Vanya thought. *Just what I needed. Now, she’s playing games*.

“Will you?”

“Sure! I arrived at the starport. I was trying to get to the grav-car rental, and this man was in the way. I tried to ask him to move, but he wouldn’t. Instead, he attacked me. I defended myself, and you know how it ended.”

What’s your relationship with Faustus Dorn?"

“Who?”

“The man you knocked out.”

“Ah. First impressions were a little rough, but I think we could grow to be friends. By the way, where is he now?”

“That’s no—” Erika tapped the clearance with a commanding finger. “Fine. He’s been dealt with. We have him on custody, and he will be put on ice once the investigation finalizes.”

“On ice? That’s practically a death sentence. Seems a little harsh for a minor public order incident.”

“We have strong reasons to believe that this individual is not acting alone, and that, left alone, would cause substantially more damage.”

“Still, seems excessive to condemn a man for something he hasn’t done”

Vanya was starting to get *very* annoyed. Who was this woman to question their methods? She clearly hadn’t seen what people like Faustus were capable of.

“We don’t have to explain ourselves to you, Belcroft. That’s not within the bounds of the clearance.”

Erika wasn’t paying attention to her. She was lost in thought.

“I think I’m going to need all the information you have on this Faustus. In particular, I’d like his address.”

"That’s private information about a citizen of the Solar Empire. It’s outside of our jurisdiction. You’ll have to go query the Archive, *like everyone else.*"

“But you have his information in one of these papers here, right?” In reality, the clearance *did* entitle Erika for that information. In fact, the Corporation should keep address records themselves. But, since apparently Belcoft wasn’t aware of that, she would have to go all the way to the Archive. Vanya took this as a personal victory.

Erika looked around her desk. Vanya was quick enough to snatch Faustus’s file before Erika had a chance to read it. Erika continued “Okay, message recieved. I’m getting bored. Anything else you need, Enforcer?”

*Yes,* Vanya thought *but with that clearance, you’re not going to give me anything, are you?*

Erika’s eyes responded *no, I’m not.* Vanya cleared her throat.

“Not for now, mamzel Belcroft. We will be in contact if we need anything else. In the meantime, please try not knocking anyone else down.”

Vanya stood up and reached out to shake Erika’s hand. Erika got up, ignored the hand, and started walking away.

---

Back in her flier, Erika was caressing Tristan's fur.

“You know, dear, I think I was a little too hard on that Enforcer. She was doing a good job. A pity we can’t work together, but like hell I’m going to let father go to the freezer.” Tristan purred in agreement.

“Now, there *is* something of value to rescue from this episode.” Erika blinked, and the augmetic in her eye started replaying an account of what had happened. “I’m not going to the Archive just for someone’s address.” She looked through the frames, searching for a precise moment.

“There.” She saw the Enforcer’s desk, full of papers, and spotted the one with Faustus’ information. “Now we just make it a bit bigger… there we have it! Hab 405, Level 169. Ugh, the Grids again. Well, Tristan, let’s go take a look.”

The gravcar lifted off, once more into the smog.

# Faustus

The seams of the grav-car’s doors hissed in a cloud of steam, and the passenger cabin popped open. Erika skipped to the chasis of her flier, hoping to not scratch the paint. When she looked down, she saw the great pit of nothing the grav-car was hovering over. Before her, across the railguard, there was a narrow passage connnecting all the living units. Beyond that passage, the stencil on the door indicated: Hab 405-NNC, Level 169.

“Let’s see what we find, shall we dear?” She hopped gracefully over the railguard, onto the passage. The cat followed suit.

The door was closed but, to Erika’s surprise, it had been left unlocked. The previous owner must have left in a hurry. “Well, Faustus, tell me your secrets” She said, pressing a button of the door’s console.

The door hissed open, and both woman and cat crossed it threshold. Erika looked around, and her jaw dropped.

She had seen many things. She had seen men die around her, cut down by alien beasts. Even before then, she had seen a thousand battles in the Academy’s training Cognitors. She had seen the horrors war had to offer.

She had never seen anything like that.

The walls, the ceiling, the floor… even the window was covered with tiny red letters, forming paragraphs upon paragraphs of incoherent blabber. There were lines where “I am” were the only words, repeated from one end of the wall to the other. Lines where Faustus was apparently talking to someone named Jorrick, asking him to stop showing him something.

By the time the scribbles reached the ceiling, only one name was legible amid the sea of half-written letters: Kyriel.

“Dear Sol”, she said, in awe. Not even in the most desperate of battles had Erika seen someone driven as mad as Faustus had. “What does this to a person?” She muttered, under her breath. A chilling thought crept through the back of her neck. This wasn’t Pod Disease, this was something worse. Something more… sinister. *Is this what awaits Father?*.

She did not dare say that one out loud.

Erika swallowed, and pushed the doubt out of her mind. She forced herself to focus, and took in the rest of the room. The entire hab took less space than her small closet. It could only be described as a narrow, short corridor of plascrete. A pile of dirty overalls covered what little space there was between the unmade bed and the filthy sink. Erika could swear there was a chair beneath all those red-stained shirts. The whole room smelled rank, like a towel that has been used too many times. The smoke of an unfinished tabac-stick fogged the window above the sink.

Erika paused.

A smoking tabac-stick.

She darted into action, moving herself to be flat against the door’s wall. She unholstered her lasgun and waved her head, and Tristan darted behind the pile of clothes, hiding. Erika waited for the owner of the tabac-stick to come back.

Still.

Expectant.

Not a minute later, a figure burst through the door. Erika didn’t waste a second. She grabbed it by the wrists and set her right foot forward at the same time. The figure lost balance and fell, face first, on the hard plascrete floor. She spun and dove, with the surgical precision of an expert combatant, pressing her knee on the back of the figure’s neck. She pointed her gun at the person’s head.

“Who are you and what are you doing here, quick.” Erika said.

“Wait! Don’t shoot! Are you crazy?” That voice was… young. A boy, a teenager. It sounded familiar.

“Answer the question, boy. Give me a reason not to shoot.”

“I’m the one that was following you! Remember? Last night? It was me! You knocked out my lead?” Said the boy. Erika remembered his terrible attempt at intimidation, and eased the pressure of his neck. “I’m here to warn you. They’re coming.”

“Who is?” Erika said.

A loud bang followed. She barely managed to duck in time to dodge the solid round. She felt a sharp pain in her right hand, and dropped her lasgun.

Erika rolled forward, taking cover behind the bed. In the blink of an eye, the sheath of her cane was flying across the room, and her power-rapier was humming in her hand. She saw Tristan still hiding behind the pile of clothes, and connected her augmetic eye to the cat’s.

There were three men standing between Erika and the door, dressed in lower-hive worker garbs. They were armed with long combat knives, and one of them was shooting at her with a stub gun. The other two were approaching the bed, encircling her.

Through Tristan’s eye, she saw the man adjust his aim, and shoot towards her crouching figure. The shots bounced off of the bed’s solid frame, lodging themselves in the brittle walls. Erika had seen this before, and knew how it ended. She disconnected from Tristan, and waited.

After a few more rounds, the man stopped to reload. Erika seized that window, springing from the bed and rushing him. She ducked, slipping below the knife of the first man, and lurched forward. Her sword buzzed as it penetrated the chest of the shooter and lodged on the wall behind him, filling the tiny room with the smell of burnt flesh.

She turned around without wasting a second, ready to strike down another one.

“Alright, let’s all calm down!” said the third man. He was using the boy as a human shield, and was holding a knife to his throat. Erika stopped her blade, inches from the man’s face. “Nobody has to get hurt, right Vince?”

“That’s right, Carl” said the other man.

“You should have thought of that before shooting” Erika said, nodding towards the body pinned to the wall.

“That’s probably true, but we got orders, you see. Now put the fancy glowknife out, or the boy gets it.”

Erika evaluated the situation. Despite their clothes, the men didn’t look like workers. She could see scars in their bare forearms and necks, and she could tell by their response to their compatriot’s demise that they were no stranger to death. These men were serious.

The boy, however, was another story. His face showed the stark surprise of someone who just realised they’re in over their head. He was staring at her, his eyes pleading for help.

“Go ahead, be my guest” Erika said, shrugging. The boy’s eyes opened in horror.

“No! Wait! I knew the man that lived here! I know why you’re here, I can help you!” he said.

*Now that’s interesting*, thought Erika. She looked at Carl, then Vince, and finally the boy, evaluating how much she trusted his word. She sighed. “Fine.” She powered off her sword, throwing it to the ground. “I yield.” She would have to do this the hard way.

Carl smiled. “That’s more like it. Now, on your knees.”

As Erika and the boy kneeled side by side, Carl picked up his tabac-stick from the sink, lighting it.

"Now. We find ourselves in a bit of a pickle, wouldn’t you say so, Vince?” Carl continued, going back to his fallen partner. He picked up the stub gun, and reloaded it with some rounds from the corpse. “You see, we were sent here to make sure that nobody could trace poor Faustus back to our boss. And here you both are, tracing Faustus back to our boss. Shouldn’t have done that." Carl aimed the gun at Erika. "So. What can we do now?"

Vince picked up Erika’s sword. “This is a fine piece ma’am.” he said, turning it on. *Bad mistake*, Erika thought, *shouldn’t have touched that*.

“Well, I’ve got some ideas.” Erika said. She made a head gesture, and Tristan’s augmetic legs propelled him across the room. Before he could react, Carl was hit by sixty pounds of steel and fur, toppling him to the floor. The gun’s threat removed, Erika tackled Vince, impaling him with her own sword. She turned to Carl. The man’s screams were mixed with a gurgling sound. Tristan’s adamantium claws had opened a deep gush in the man’s neck, and blood was pouring out onto the floor. Erika ended the man’s suffering with an expert cut.

As Carl’s last spasms died down, silence creeped into the hab-block. Erika turned to the boy. He was trembling, not quite sure how to react to what he had just seen. Erika remembered the first times she had seen death, during her trainings in the Academy, and almost took pity on him. She picked her weapons.

“Are you hurt?” She asked.

“No I’m… fine, I think.” The boy answered, eyes fixed on the mess of Carl’s neck.

“They would have killed us.” She said matter-of-factly.

“I know. There’s just so much… blood.”

“I suggest you look away, boy.” Her patience was wearing thin. “You said you could help me. Go on, then. Show me that I didn’t risk my neck for nothing.”

The boy shook his head, and stared at Erika. There was fear in his eyes. “I lied. I don’t know anything about this man. You got him arrested before I could even learn his name.” He lowered his eyes, not daring to look at Erika’s hardened stare. He was shaking from head to toe. “Please don’t kill me.”

Erika considered it. On the one hand, this boy had seen her, and could probably alert the authorities of what happened here. On the other hand, she had to admit that he had been pretty clever. She would have probably done something similar in his place, and she respected that. Plus, he probably had more to lose than her if he told the Enforcers. Erika sheathed her sword.

“I’m not going to kill you.” Tristan skipped over to her, and she pet his head. The boy looked at her, still tense. “I probably would have done the same. What’s your name, boy?”

“I’m Rien.”

“Get up, Rien.” The boy got up, regaining some measure of confidence. “You need to stop following me. I can’t have you pulling things like that, you’re going to get us both killed. What were you doing here, anyway?”

The boy hesitated. “You took out my lead. I had been following that man for a while, and you just go and get him arrested. And then you show up, in your fancy car, showing off all over the Grid. I thought maybe you knew something. I’d seen the men go in and out of this house, so I came in to warn you. I wasn’t following you… This time.”

Erika couldn’t help but smile. She definitely wouldn’t have done *that*. It was too foolhardy.

“That was a risky move, Rien. I could have killed you.”

“I… I know, ma’am. I just don’t have a choice, ma’am.” Rien looked straight into her eyes. Erika could see a fierce determination mixed with hope. “And judging by you coming down here to the Grids, I suspect that neither do you.”

Erika stared at him, realising what he was implying. *Poor boy*, she thought. She was sure that he also had someone… ill.

“I can’t help you.” She said. “I’m sorry.” The boy lowered his stare, and Erika could see he was holding in tears. “But here, take this.” She handed the boy a bar of credits “For your trouble.”

“I don’t want your money!” Rien snapped at her. “I want my sister back!” He said, tears running from his eyes. “Please, let me help you. I don’t know what to do anymore.”

Erika felt a ping of pain, but remained strong. “You would only hold me back, boy. I can’t do this if I have to worry about you getting hurt. I’m sorry for your sister. Go home, and pray for her recovery.”

Rien looked at her, hurt. Erika could hear him sobbing as he ran out of the room, splashing on the pooling blood.

Erika stood there, thinking for a moment. She didn’t feel good about leaving the boy behind, but it didn’t make it any less true. Whoever was behind this had sent three thugs like these to dispatch a crazy man’s house. One didn’t send that kind of force unless they had something big to hide.

That was no place for a boy.

The burning was slowly being replaced by the sickly sweet smell of death. Tristan miaowed, and she snapped out of her musings. That was still her only lead, so she had to make it count. Somebody must have heard the shots and alerted the Enforcers. She’d have to move quickly. Erika started inspecting the three bodies laid on the floor.

All three of them were muscular and well-built. Tatoos on their forearms identified them as military, and cheap prosthesis identified them as unfit for service. 53rd Decoratian Artillery, the few lucky ones that survived the Hyrum massacre. *How does one stoop so low? From serving the Empire in glorious battle to common street thug.*

Amid the hand-rolled tabac-sticks and the loose change, Erika found a small, hexagonal plastek piece in Vince’s pocket. The chipped paint was bright pink, and it had “Constanza’s” written in big cyan font. *Better than nothing.* Erika thought. She would have to figure out what this was.

She was storing the coin in her pocket as she exited the house, when she heard the Enforcer fliers approaching.

“Agent Minsk! How nice to see you again.” Erika said, as the familiar figure stepped out of the craft. “I know what this looks like, but I assure you that this was mere self-defense.” she added, when she saw the Enforcer’s face.

“That remains to be seen, Major.” Valya Minsk’s expression was equal proportions angry and upset, with a hint of impatience. “Because it sure doesn’t look like it.”

“Of course!” Erika said, in the most conciliatory tone she could manage. Enforcers couldn’t do anything to her, but this news would run fast. “I have it all recorded, if you’ll allow me.”

Erika tapped her left temple, and an image started projecting from her left eye. The Enforcers watched, astonished, as the whole fight — from Erika’s perspective — played out in front of them. All of them, except Minsk.

“So that’s how you got this lead, huh. In headquarters, with the implant?” Surprise and a little respect were added to her angry expression.

“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about” Erika answered.

“Yeah, sure you don’t.” She signalled the other Enforcers to start processing the scene. “That may have been self-defense, but that doesn’t explain what you were doing here in the first place.”

“I’m just a concerned citizen, agent.” Erika could see the frustration bubbling behind Minsk’s eyes. She felt a ping of regret. She was enjoying this too much. Under different circumstances, they could have been good friends. Of course, none of this showed on her face.

She jumped into the driver’s seat of her flier, ready to go. As she was waking the motors, an idea crossed Erika’s mind.

“I’m exhausted after all this. I think I’ll go to Constanza’s, and relax a little.” It was a gamble, but if she was right…

Minsk looked genuinely surprised now. “Constanza’s? What’s a brut like you have to do with a gang like that one? Didn’t peg you for the PleaseCog type.”

*Bingo.*

“Well, one has her weaknesses, I suppose.” Erika couldn’t help herself, and winked. As the pilot’s dome closed and they moved away from the Grid, Erika could see Minsk’s face as she realized what had happened.

*I shouldn’t have rubbed it in, that was very imprudent* She thought, as she raised back into clean air, on her way to the Archive. That name Kyriel meant something, and she would find out what.

# Shadow

In the dark corners of a troubled mind, two voices were talking.

“He got captured.” One of the voices said. A wet, throaty tone punctuated the remark.

“How is it that you couldn’t control him?” The second one asked. This sounded more natural, more… human.

“That’s none of your business.”

The second voice didn’t like that remark. “I thought we were together on this.”

There was stony silence for a few seconds. Then, the first voice returned.

“We are. Apologies…” It added, flatly. “There was a woman. Some official, from the Peacekeeping Corps. She cut the experiment short.”

A woman’s image materialized in the mind. She was middle-aged, somewhere between thirty and fifty years old. Her dark hair was neatly tied into a short ponytail. She wore military clothes, a tight-fitting gray waistcoat, and gray pants. The waistcoat’s tail flared as she moved around. She hadn’t drawn her standard issue gun, but she was brandishing a walking cane.

“You know her” Said the wet, gurgly voice. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes, I do.” The second voice paused for a second “Erika Belcroft…”

“Will she be a threat to the plan?”

The other voice thought for a second. Finally, it admitted “Possibly. I don’t know why she’s here, but we should be careful with her.”

“Let’s kill her.” The wet voice said that with a hungry tone that made the other voice uncomfortable.

“No! We’ve already talked about this. We’re not killing anyone.” Behind the finality of those words, both of them could feel the doubt and uncertainty.

The first voice didn’t respond, but rather let the hunger linger, overwhelming the corners of the shared mind. The hunger turned into urgency. A sense of being cornered, of needing to act, came over both of them. When it mutated into fear, the second voice pleaded.

“Okay, enough!” It sounded like it was choking.

Slowly, methodically, the sensations receded, like the tide. The mind was clear again.

“We need to stick with the plan.” The second voice continued, now more sure of itself. “We didn’t get to finish the experiment with Faustus, but we got what we needed.” The voice was reassuring itself more than it was speaking to the other one. “Soon, we will continue into the next phase.”

There was just silence.

Somewhere, in a dark room, a figure sank its head in its hands, and sobbed lightly.
