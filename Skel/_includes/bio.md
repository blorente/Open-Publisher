# About the Author

Borja Lorente is a Software Engineer with a passion for exploring imaginary worlds. His titles only include this very volume you're holding, but he enjoyed the process so much that he hopes to have another book out soon.

Born in Spain, he now lives in London, UK, with his wonderful girlfriend and his two cats, Ember and Cinder. When he's not making stuff up, he can be found working in developer tooling for one company or another, most recently Twitter and Apple, or playing Dungeons and Dragons with his friends.

You can find him online at [www.blorente.me/books](https://blorente.me/books).
